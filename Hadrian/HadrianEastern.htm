<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The first &quot;sight&quot; of the
next day was the Temple of Mithras, at Carrawbrugh. Worship of
Mithras was a common religion among the Roman soldiers,
especially the officers. </font><a href="MithrasB.jpg"><font
face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="Mithras.jpg" align="right"
border="0" hspace="8" vspace="9" width="595" height="360"></font></a><font
face="Comic Sans MS">Several days later when we had finished the
walk, we visited the Museum of Antiquities in Newcastle, where
there was an exhibit that we all enjoyed. The display is based on
this particular site at Carrawbrugh, and it's a partial
reconstruction of the temple. We sat on a bench in the darkened
reconstruction, as though we were there in the temple itself, and
watched shadowy figures in front of us explaining the Mithraic
worship service.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We soon walked past another fort,
Brocolitia, which is entirely un-excavated. There are just lumps
and ridges on the ground indicating the presence of ruins under
them. Then an hour later we came to &quot;Limestone Corner.&quot;
This is the renowned spot in the North Ditch where the Roman wall
builders seem to have given up on their rock-splitting job. </font><a
href="LimestoneCornerB.jpg"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="LimestoneCorner.jpg" align="left" border="0" hspace="9"
vspace="9" width="480" height="360"></font></a><font
face="Comic Sans MS">There are even slots still showing on some
of the boulders indicating that the workers had tried
unsuccessfully to split them by the expansion of wooden wedges
inserted and soaked with water (a standard technique). The Whin
Sill is made of very hard dolerite rock indeed! So the boulders
here are just lying around where the Romans left them, still in
the middle of the ditch! We enjoyed exploring among them, looking
for signs of the attempted stone-cutting.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We walked through more farmland,
sometimes fields of bright yellow rapeseed, sometimes grazing
fields. There were many sheep, of course, of different varieties.
These lambs had strikingly black faces.</font><a
href="LambsUnderTreeB.jpg"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img

vspace="9" width="480" height="338"></font></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Throughout the walk, we enjoyed the
hawthorns with their pretty white blossoms. Here the sheep were
enjoying them as a shady place to rest.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="SheepUnderTreeB.jpg"><img src="SheepUnderTree.jpg"

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">After several hours of pleasant
walking we came to Chesters Fort. We started off in the excellent
museum. As we entered, </font><a href="QuarryStoneB.jpg"><font
face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="QuarryStone.jpg" align="right"
border="0" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="548" height="250"></font></a><font
face="Comic Sans MS">we almost tripped over the famous Written
Rock, right outside the door. This is a rock from one of the
quarries which the wall builders used. It says &quot;PETRA
FLAVI(I) CARANTINI&quot;, and it's thought that said Flavius was
probably the foreman of the gang doing the quarrying. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Inside the small museum there's a
collection of hundreds of artifacts from the forts and
milecastles and surrounding areas. There are dozens of altars,
for example, as well as case after case of pottery, utensils, and
clothing. After enjoying the exhibit, about the time we were
starting to be overwhelmed by it, we went out to the cafe for
coffee.</font><a href="ChestersMuseumB.jpg"><font
face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="ChestersMuseum.jpg" align="left"
border="0" hspace="9" vspace="9" width="480" height="360"></font></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we wandered through the ruins
of the large fort, seeing barracks blocks and headquarters
building and commandant's house, before heading down to the
bath-house beside the river. This is Chesters' most famous
feature, as its walls are intact to a fairly good height. One
walks in by the entrance hall and dressing room, and can wander
through the warm room, hot room, cold room, sweating chamber, and
hot dry room, among others. Quite impressive!</font></p>

        were glad to see the Planetrees section of the Wall.
        (Planetrees is the name of the farm that it's on.) This
        section is special for two reasons. The more important
        historically is that this is exactly the place where the
        Wall builders (working from east to west) stopped
        building at the ten-foot width and reduced it to eight
        feet. But the other reason is that this is the stretch
        where William Hutton begged workers to stop demolishing
        the wall. Hutton considered himself the first person to
        walk the length of the Wall. He did so in 1802, was sure
        that he would be the last person to walk the whole length
        (!), and wrote a book about it.</font></td>

        Farm, and the area is called Heavenfield. There was a
        battle here in 634. Oswald, King of Northumbria, defeated
        the British. Oswald was Christian and the British were
        heathen, and this is thought to be a turning point in the
        conversion of Britain to Christianity. A church was built
        here, largely from Wall-stone, but the present church was
        mostly reconstructed in the 18th century.</font></td>

the Wall goes right under the middle of the house! We had read
that the house is built with quite a few Wall-stones, and they
showed us the Roman stones in their farmhouse wall. And they
showed us the extra special stone high up in the front of the
house, a centurial stone! (The </font><font size="5"

        farm, and then along a particularly well-preserved
        stretch of the north ditch. This view is looking back
        (west) toward St. Oswald's farmhouse, seen at the far end
        of the ditch. The main east-west road here runs exactly
        on top of Hadrian's Wall, that is, directly to the south
        (left) of the ditch. This is not an accident. At the time
        of the Jacobite rebellion in 1747, General George Wade
        was on the east side of the country, near Newcastle.
        Bonnie Prince Charlie and his troops advanced south on
        the west side, near Carlisle. There was no good road for
        Wade to use. In frustration, he called for the east-west
        raod to be built. The easiest route was the route that
        the Romans had taken, at least until the Wall went up
        onto the Whin Sill. So Wade's men demolished the Wall and
        used the stones to build a road in the same place. So
        much for the 20 miles of Wall west of Newcastle!</font></td>

the south, for a one-day excursion off the Wall path. This was to
the town of Corbridge, mainly to see the Roman fort there, called
Corstopitum. Where we turned there was a field with some Belted
Galloway cows, with their totally improbable coloring. Here's a
calf:</font></p>

lunch and then went to the fort. It has the best preserved
granary of any fort, with much of the floor still extant. But
what seemed most memorable to us was the striking roller-coaster
effect. The stone fort was built on top an of earlier turf fort.
The result was that the ground subsides at different rates,
depending on what's underneath. It has a very funny, undulating
effect!</font></p>

finished; all the other houses are still boarded up. Our hosts
suggested a nearby pub for dinner. A young couple had bought the
pub only a few weeks before the flood. This was apparently their
first week of making dinners again. </font></p>
