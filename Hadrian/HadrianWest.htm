<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Before setting off to walk
Hadrian's Wall, we spent the morning in the Tullie House Museum
in Carlisle. We went particularly for the Roman exhibits, but
also found the stories about other epochs in Carlisle's history
fascinating. There was a video about life in the time of the
border reivers --- armed bandits who terrorized the countryside
in the border area for centuries, until about 1700.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">After lunch in the museum cafe, we
took the early afternoon bus to Bowness-on-Solway. This was a
special bus called the AD 122, named for the year that the
Emperor Hadrian commanded that the wall be built. The bus runs a
route near the Wall, and once a day goes all the way west to
Bowness-on-Solway. This was the western end of Hadrian's Wall,
though nothing of the Wall remains there today.</font></p>

the end of its route, and started walking east, as we would be
doing (roughly) for the next 84 miles (the official length of the
path; we actually walked a good bit more, with side excursions
and going to B&amp;Bs.) We soon came to a little pavilion marking
the beginning of the Hadrian's Wall Path. Two charming young
girls were there to greet us and sell us little beach stones that
they had stamped with an image of Hadrian. We asked one of them
to take our picture, and I took theirs. Above the door was a
wooden plaque wishing us well on our walk. (Above the door on the
other side was a congratulations sign, for those finishing the
walk!)</font><img src="StartingSign.jpg" align="right" hspace="8"

wall. Then in the 14th century, when border warfare was an almost
constant worry, the townspeople added the fortified tower for
their protection. The only entrance to the tower is through a
gated entrance inside the church. </font></p>
