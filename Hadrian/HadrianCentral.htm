width="480" height="360"></font></a><font face="Comic Sans MS">Today
we began seeing parts of Hadrian's Wall --- exciting! The first
was a tall chunk at Hare Hill. This is the tallest part that
remains of the Wall, though the top few feet of this piece have
actually been rebuilt. Hadrian's Wall was probably about 15 feet
originally, but nothing now is that high. Apparently it had
stayed almost intact for a thousand years after the Romans left,
around 400 AD, because people built houses of timber. But when
they began using stone as building material, the Wall was a good
source of dressed stones, and the Wall was taken away by the
cartload.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Within a few miles we were seeing
more and more of existing Wall. Near the village of Banks we saw
our first turret. Along the Wall, spaced one Roman mile apart,
there were what we now call milecastles. These housed about 30
men. Between each pair of milecastles were two turrets
(observation towers). </font></p>

        apart. These were Leahill (51B) and Sandy Sike (51A)
        turrets. Modern numbering starts at the eastern end of
        the Wall, giving numbers to milecastles and designating
        the intervening turrets with A and B. A Roman mile was
        1000 double steps, 1620 yards, slightly shorter than our

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In this area there wasn't much
stone readily available, so originally the Wall was built from
squares of turf. It was probably about the same height as the
stone portion, and quite solid and substantial. A few years
later, the Romans rebuilt most of the turf wall in stone, but on
this particular stretch, the stone wall was built a few hundred
yards to the north of the turf wall. </font><a
href="TurfWallB.jpg"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="TurfWall.jpg" align="right" border="0" hspace="8" vspace="8"
width="626" height="214"></font></a><font face="Comic Sans MS">For
a short while we were walking beside what remains of the original
turf wall. The sheep were lazily sleeping on the top of it.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">After visiting the fort of
Birdoswald, we were finally walking beside long segments of Wall.
We found (with the help of a guidebook) a centurial stone, one of
the stones</font><a href="CenturialStoneB.jpg"><font
face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="CenturialStone.jpg" align="left"
border="0" hspace="10" vspace="8" width="450" height="320"></font></a><font
face="Comic Sans MS"> inserted into the wall when a centurion and
his cohort finished an assigned portion of wall-building. This
one says &quot;Julius Primus of the VIII Cohort was responsible
for building this legionary length.&quot; Clearly considerable
shorthand was used!</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As we walked beside the Wall, we
could see in the distance our route for the next day, up and down
the &quot;Nine Nicks of Thirlwall.&quot; The central section of
Hadrian's Wall follows the top edge of the Whin Sill, a ridge of
hard quartz-basalt that extends across northern England to the
North Sea. This &quot;sill&quot; rises and falls, often with a
rock face on the northern side. Since this helped defensively,
the Romans built the wall along the top edge of the sill. The
&quot;Nine Nicks of Thirlwall&quot; refer to the (originally)
nine gaps in the sill. Modern quarrying has removed several of
the rock faces.</font></p>

height="360"></a></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Wall along here shows well the
two widths that were used. At first the Wall was built ten feet
wide. But while construction was in progress, the decision was
made to make it eight feet, instead. One conjecture is that this
was to save time. Long stretches of base had already been laid at
the ten foot specification, so the upper part, completed later,
is two feet narrower. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Half an hour later we came to
Poltross Burn Milecastle, the best-preserved milecastle on the
Wall. One of its features that's remarked on is the set of steps
in the northeast corner. Historians have extrapolated from these
steps, extending them up to a presumed parapet walk on top of the
Wall, to estimate that the the Wall was probably about 15 feet
high.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The following day started with a
visit to the ruins of 14th century Thirlwall Castle, built mostly
with Wall stones. </font><a href="ThirlwallCastleB.jpg"><font
face="Comic Sans MS"><img src="ThirlwallCastle.jpg" align="left"
border="0" hspace="9" vspace="9" width="400" height="300"></font></a><font
face="Comic Sans MS">There followed a very enjoyable hour or so
in the Roman Army Museum at Carvoran. One video they were showing
was a recruitment advertisement for the Roman Army. You get to
wear stylish armor, and will become a Roman citizen after 25
years! </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we were at the beginning of the
Whin Sill up-and-down part. We passed a disused quarry and the
lake that it had formed, and then climed steeply up. At the top,
we were walking beside a section of Wall that was higher than any
earlier section we'd seen.</font><a href="AboveWalltownB.jpg"><font

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We ate lunch while sitting beside a
turret partway up one of the Whin Sill crests, with a view back
over the &quot;nick&quot; we had just come up from.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We were treated to a comedy just
before walking through this farm. The lambs were playing games.
They tried to chase the rooster, but </font><a
href="BouncingLambsB.jpg"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="BouncingLambs.jpg" align="left" border="0" hspace="8"
vspace="8" width="480" height="276"></font></a><font
face="Comic Sans MS">the rooster turned and faced them and they
all ran. Then they tried to frighten the cat on the wall, but the
cat growled and they ran. Then they just played by themselves,
running and bouncing up in the air. They were hilarious. This
should be a movie! </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Soon we were at Aesica, or Great
Chesters Fort. It's part of a working farm, and the farmer isn't
interested in having archaeologists excavating there, so one
wanders among mounds with partially exposed stones. The forts
along the Wall were built a few years after the Wall itself.
Presumably the authorities decided that it was too slow getting
troops to the Wall from the existing forts, several miles south.</font><a

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Here it looks as if Thann is
surreptitiously swiping coins (honest, he wasn't), but the altar
is of interest because it's the only altar along the Wall still
in place. There are many others in the museums.</font><a

enjoyable walking, including a short stretch where we were
allowed to walk actually on top of the Wall, we came to
Housesteads Fort. This is one that was built on the line of the
Wall, and it has more building foundations than most of the
others. The photo on the left is the base of a granary. The
granaries in each fort were supposed to hold enough to supply
1000 men for a year - a lot of food. They were always ventilated
with air space under the floor, which was supported by many short
columns. The picture on the right is of the latrine. This was a
communal meeting place, with two rows of seats, and a cistern
sending constant running water under the seats. </font></p>
