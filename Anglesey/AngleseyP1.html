<p class="auto-style12">The route goes inland for a few miles in order to go 
around the large estate of Plas Newydd, the home of the Marquess of Anglesey.&nbsp; 
But a bonus of going inland was that we soon came to a Neolithic burial mound, 
Bryn Celli Ddu.&nbsp; Like Stonehenge in England, Newgrange in Ireland, and Maeshowe on 
Orkney, it's oriented so that the rising sun on the longest day of the year 
shines down the passageway.&nbsp; We squatted and made our way into the central 
chamber.</p>

<p class="auto-style12">After another couple of miles we were back at the water's 
edge.&nbsp; This is the Menai Strait, separating Anglesey from mainland Wales.&nbsp; 
Our notes said that this structure below was for storage of munitions, with 
round sides so that in case of an explosion the roof would blow off and the 
sides would survive.</p>
<p class="auto-style11">
<img alt="" height="275" src="wIMG_3291.jpg" width="720" class="auto-style14" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">A bit of rocky shore brought us to a statue of Lord 
Nelson.&nbsp; This was sculpted by a son of the Marquis of Anglesey.</p>
<p class="auto-style11">
<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_3296.jpg" width="720" class="auto-style14" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">
We soon turned inland, toward St. Mary's Church in Llanfairpwll.&nbsp; 
Llanfairpwll is of course well-known for its extravagantly long full name: 
Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.&nbsp; There are many 
towns in Wales with names beginning "Llanfair", because it means "St. Mary's", 
so they need something else to distinguish them.&nbsp; This, however, is 
excessive!</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_3299.jpg" width="720" /></p>

<p class="auto-style12">Within a short distance, we found ourselves going under 
the Britannia Bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was originally designed for the railroad, 
and it had been a&nbsp; tubular bridge.&nbsp; Trains went through big rectangular 
box-like tubes.&nbsp; But in 1970 teenagers sneaked in and lighted some paper to be able 
to see in the darkness.&nbsp; They accidentally dropped the paper, starting a 
horrific fire that destroyed the tubes.&nbsp; The rebuilt bridge is no longer 
tubular.&nbsp; It has two levels, the lower for trains and the upper for cars.</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="414" src="wIMG_3303.jpg" width="718" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">It's only about a mile to the other bridge across the 
Menai Strait.&nbsp; This one was earlier, built by Thomas Telford beginning 
in 1819, much larger than any other suspension bridge at the time it was built.</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="347" src="wIMG_3305.jpg" width="720" /></p>

<p class="auto-style12">We walked under this bridge, too:</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="524" src="wIMG_3322.jpg" width="720" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">The small town at the end of the bridge is Menai Bridge, 
and from there we went inland (and uphill) for five miles or so, through the 
village of Llandegfan and then down to Beaumaris.&nbsp; Here's the approach to 
Beaumaris along the seafront:</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="370" src="wIMG_3329.jpg" width="720" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">And at the far end of the town is Beaumaris Castle, the 
last of the Edward I (boo, hiss) castles built to subdue the Welsh.</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="429" src="wIMG_3330.jpg" width="900" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">A mile beyond Beaumaris, after crossing a pleasant 
grassy hillside where lots of people were out enjoying the sunny Sunday 
afternoon, we dropped down again to the coast.&nbsp; There was a choice here.&nbsp; 
If it's not high tide one can walk along the shore, and we thought we would be 
all right.&nbsp; (Our book does say in italics "<em>Do not attempt to walk along the 
shore to Trwyn y Penrhyn within one hour either side of high tide</em>" because the 
tide will reach up to the cliffs.)&nbsp; When we started along the shore we came 
to a family group sitting on the rocks.&nbsp; They advised us against trying the 
shore walk.&nbsp; (Advised strongly, in fact.)&nbsp; So we went back inland.&nbsp; 
One advantage was that a couple of miles along on our detour we could visit the 
ruins of a castle, Castell Lleiniog.&nbsp; This was originally a motte and 
bailey castle built in 1090 by one of William the Conqueror's buddies.&nbsp; 
Three years later, the Welsh captured it, and thereby kept the Normans out of 
north Wales for the next 100 years.&nbsp; What's showing now is a later 
structure, a stone fort, built on top of the motte.</p>

<p class="auto-style12">By the time we arrived at Penmon Priory, it was well 
past their 4:00 closing, but a woman came out of the next-door house and asked 
whether we'd like to go in.&nbsp;&nbsp; She kindly opened the priory for us.</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="790" src="wIMG_3359.jpg" width="630" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">St Seriol set up a monastery here, in the 6th century, 
when many such religious communities were being formed in the Celtic world.&nbsp; 
The two crosses which were at the gate of the monastery survive, but the church 
was destroyed by a Viking raid in 971.&nbsp; The stone priory is from the 13th 
century, and was part of Llywelyn the Great's support of the Augustinian Order.</p>
<table align="center" style="width: 80%">
	<tr>

<p class="auto-style12">Nearby there's a dovecote.&nbsp; When Henry VIII 
dissolved the monasteries in 1538, Penmon was given to a prominent local family.&nbsp; 
They built the dovecote around 1600, to supply meat and eggs for their estate.&nbsp; 
The dovecote has nesting cublcles for about 930 pigeons.&nbsp; The pigeons could 
fly in and out through an opening in the roof.</p>

<p class="auto-style12">Our final sight for the day was Penmon Point, with its 
lighthouse and Puffin Island beyond.</p>

<img alt="" height="440" src="wIMG_3372.jpg" width="1080" /></p>

<p class="auto-style12">An artist, Anthony Garratt, has made large weather-proof paintings of four 
scenes around the coast.&nbsp; These paintings have been placed at the 
appropriate spots and will remain there through the summer.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
