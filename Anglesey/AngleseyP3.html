<p class="auto-style12">Just past Cemaes, there was an 
exhibit with stands holding little rocks with descriptions.&nbsp; One was 
"pebble erratics".&nbsp; On several of the beaches where we walked, there were 
these rocks under foot.&nbsp; They were beautiful and interesting.</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="675" src="wIMG_3470.jpg" width="900" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">In sight from this exhibit was the Wylfa Nuclear Power 
Station.&nbsp; It's in sight for many miles, to the disgust of many coast path 
walkers.</p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="607" src="wIMG_3473.jpg" width="900" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">Our route took us out around the headland showing above, 
then back past the power station.&nbsp; There were pretty coves, before the 
station...</p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="369" src="wIMG_3476.jpg" width="720" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">and after:</p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="675" src="wIMG_3478.jpg" width="900" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">Looking outward from this little bridge, one would see this cove 
with a pair of greylag geese.</p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="499" src="wIMG_3479f.jpg" width="900" /></p>

<p class="auto-style12">Only a mile further along we came to the interesting 
Cemlyn Bay.&nbsp; Here the prevalent onshore winds have formed a shingle ridge.&nbsp; 
Beyond the ridge is a lagoon which has become a wildlife preserve.&nbsp; The 
lagoon is home to many varieties of birds, many of whom we saw.&nbsp; We walked 
beside the lagoon until we came to a barrier and a sign advising us how to avoid 
disturbing nests.</p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="507" src="wIMG_3485.jpg" width="900" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">We then walked along the shingle ridge.&nbsp; The little 
stones underfoot were all rounded and amazingly beautiful.&nbsp; These were like 
the "pebble erratics" we had just seen in the exhibit near Cemaes.&nbsp; Here's an 
example:</p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="675" src="wIMG_3486.jpg" width="900" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">We always like watching lambs.&nbsp; This bunch was 
having a good time.</p>

<p class="auto-style12">A few miles along, at Carmel Head, the coast reaches a 
corner and here we turned south.&nbsp; Just before that, there are two big structures 
called the "White Ladies".&nbsp; These, along with a similar one on an island, 
were built to aid in navigation around Carmel Head.</p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="531" src="wIMG_3499.jpg" width="1080" /></p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="688" src="wIMG_3501.jpg" width="540" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">Beyond the White Ladies we came to an electric 
fence across the path.&nbsp; We had learned not long ago that when a farmer puts 
an electric wire across a public footpath, there's a requirement that there be a 
way to unhook it.&nbsp; So we looked, found the big rubber handle, and used it.&nbsp; 
Here's Thann re-hooking the wire after we had gone through.</p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="504" src="wIMG_3505.jpg" width="720" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">Onward then, around and above inlets.</p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="679" src="wIMG_3507.jpg" width="900" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">
At one of the inlets we saw this sea arch.&nbsp; There are 
several of these scattered around Anglesey.</p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="483" src="wIMG_3509.jpg" width="720" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">
After a while we approached Church Bay, which presented a splendid panorama.</p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="608" src="wIMG_3513.jpg" width="810" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">Some miles beyond Church Bay comes the Alaw River, and 
its wide estuary.&nbsp; Until a few months ago, this was a real problem for 
coastal path walkers.&nbsp; They had to go several miles inland beside the 
estuary, but then they came to a major fast highway with no room beside it for 
walkers.&nbsp; The official advice was to take a bus for several miles.&nbsp; 
But fortunately for us, a bridge across the Alaw has been built.&nbsp; It took 
years, and much work getting needed permissions.&nbsp; The result is a beauty: </p>

<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="583" src="wIMG_3524.jpg" width="900" /></p>

<p class="auto-style12">A few miles later we crossed the Stanley Embankment.&nbsp; 
This is an almost-mile-long structure joining Holy Island to the island of 
Anglesey.&nbsp; It was designed by Thomas Telford and built in the early 19th 
century.&nbsp; Later a train line was added.&nbsp; According to Wikipedia, "When 
this was completed in 1848 a tall dividing wall had to be built between road and 
rail so the trains did not startle the horses on the road."&nbsp; Nearing Holyhead we 
entered a park.&nbsp; There 
was an area with picnic tables as well as a food van, "Pete's Burger Bar".&nbsp; 
We were freezing, and were overjoyed to find that "Pete" specialized in hot 
chocolate drinks.&nbsp; We each had a couple of them!</p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="724" src="wIMG_3531.jpg" width="720" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">A few hours later we were at St. Cybi's Church, in 
Holyhead.&nbsp; Holyhead is now known mainly for its function as the main port 
for ferries to Dublin.&nbsp; It has in fact been a port since Roman times.&nbsp; 
St. Cybi's Church is inside the walls of a Roman fort, which was built to 
protect the harbor.&nbsp; In Welsh, Holyhead is Caergybi, the fort of Cybi.&nbsp;

<p class="auto-style12">Saint Cybi's Church is the official starting and ending 
point of the coastal walk.</p>
