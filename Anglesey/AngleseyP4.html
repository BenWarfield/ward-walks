<p class="auto-style12">In Holyhead we had an excellent dinner and stayed in an excellent 
B&amp;B, but the next day we woke to rain.&nbsp; This was unfortunate, because we 
missed out on some views that we had looked forward to.&nbsp; The morning was a 
climb up Holyhead Mountain.&nbsp; This isn't high, but given that there were no 
views to be had, we didn't go to the top.&nbsp; All the same, climbing the rocky 
path had us huffing and puffing, and the rocks under foot were slippery with the 
rain that continued to pelt us.&nbsp; There were many path intersections with 
choices, and we made several wrong selections.&nbsp; We had a general rule of 
not going too far right (toward the cliffs) or too far left (toward the mountain 
top).&nbsp; We had seen pictures of the South Stack lighthouse, and we knew that 
there was a cafe not far from it.&nbsp; With great relief we found it around 
lunchtime.&nbsp; We went in, leaving puddles as we found a table.&nbsp; We had 
bowls of steaming hot broccoli and Stilton soup -- did anything ever taste that 
good?&nbsp; We stayed a long time, trying to get warm, athough actually getting 
dry was out of the question.</p>
<p class="auto-style12">The rain occasionally let up, and we spent the afternoon 
walking around one headland after another, past inlet after inlet. </p>
<p class="auto-style13">

<p class="auto-style12">We finally arrived in Trearddur, and our B&amp;B hostess was 
outstandingly kind and helpful when we appeared, dripping, at her door.&nbsp; 
She took our soaked rain trousers and jackets to her drying room and our boots 
to dry in front of her Aga.&nbsp; The place down the road where we went for 
dinner was having a power problem.&nbsp; Long after we had ordered (and my mouth 
was watering for their butternut squash, pear, and Roquefort pie), the waiter 
came back and said that they could manage only fish and chips.&nbsp; Oh, well.</p>
<p class="auto-style12">The next morning was light drizzle and heavy mist.&nbsp; 
We passed several more sea aches -- seen through the mist.</p>

<p class="auto-style12">There was a mile or two of beach walking just before our 
town for the night, Rhosneigr. &nbsp;This was a Bank Holiday Sunday, and lots of 
wind surfers were putting on a colorful display.&nbsp; There's a river before 
the town, so one has to go a half mile upstream to a footbridge.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately we missed the turn for the proper path up through the dunes, so we 
ended up making a difficult route out of what should have been simple.</p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_3544.jpg" width="720" /></p>

<p class="auto-style12">A great delight, however, was the welcome to our B&amp;B.&nbsp; 
We were walking down the main road through Rhosneigr, tired and unsure exactly 
where our B&amp;B was.&nbsp; We heard a voice from a house we had passed, calling 
out "Jennifer!".&nbsp; I almost didn't turn around, since there was no way we 
could know anyone in Rhosneigr.&nbsp; But it turned out that our hostess, 
Rachel, had been watching out the window for us.&nbsp; She saw us trudging past, 
and guessed who we were.&nbsp; What happiness! </p>
<p class="auto-style12">The next day the sun was shining again.&nbsp; We were 
now walking along the south-west side of Anglesey, and the coast was totally 
different from the cliffs of the north.</p>

<p class="auto-style12">All morning, ever since we left Rhosneigr, we had been 
hearing the roar of motorcycles.&nbsp; By late morning, we finally were passing 
the source of the noise - a racing circuit.&nbsp; We walked past it, but it was 
above us and mostly hidden by shrubbery.&nbsp; We climbed up and had a bit of a 
view of the racers.</p>
<p class="auto-style12">Fortunately, because we were dropping down to the beach 
level, the sound lessened considerably.&nbsp; It was a welcome relief, just as 
we came to the sight of the "Church in the Sea".&nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="531" src="wIMG_3563.jpg" width="1080" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">This tiny chapel, founded in the seventh century, was 
rebuilt in stone in the twelth century.&nbsp; The church was originally on a 
small peninsula, but tides eroded the land, making a tiny island.&nbsp; 
Parishioners built a causeway, but this was inundated at high tides.&nbsp; They 
eventually built a new church inland and this little church fell into disuse.&nbsp; 
It was restored in the 19th century, and there are still occasional church 
services.&nbsp; There are remains of the causeway, by which one can walk out to 
the church if it's not high tide.</p>

		<td class="auto-style12" style="width: 20%">The tide had been going out for an hour when we arrived.&nbsp; 
We decided to sit and eat our sandwiches, enjoying the scene while waiting for the water to recede some 
more.&nbsp; Then we walked on out to the church, but it was locked.&nbsp; It was 
		hard stuffing in a donation, into the slot in the wall.</td>

<p class="auto-style12">The next day it was about an hour earlier when we 
arrived at another spot with high tide restrictions.&nbsp; Unfortunately this 
time we were out of luck.&nbsp; We could have waited a couple of hours, but it 
was very windy and we weren't patient enough.&nbsp; Llanddwyn Island sounds like 
a wonderful place to visit, and maybe we'll return some day.&nbsp; It's a tidal 
island, attached to the mainland except at highest tides, but this was a spring 
tide, and the wind was fierce that day.&nbsp; The place to cross over was well 
covered by water.</p>

<p class="auto-style12">&nbsp;<span class="auto-style12">Soon after this we were 
in Newborough Warren.&nbsp; This is an interesting area that (as its name 
implies) was once home to a tremensous number of rabbits.&nbsp; Myxomatosis 
struck in 1954, almost wiping them out.&nbsp; There are still some, grazing with 
the wild ponies.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="auto-style12"><span class="auto-style12">The area was formed 700 years 
ago, when a fierce storm blew sand inland.&nbsp; Marram grass was planted in 
Elizabethan times to stabilize the dunes, and a cottage industry sprang up, 
making marram grass mats.&nbsp; This craft continued for centuries.&nbsp; We 
came to a steel sculpture commemorating the marram grass mat makers.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="514" src="wIMG_3596.jpg" width="630" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">Close by there was a bird hide.&nbsp; Oh my, did we ever 
appreciate that!&nbsp; The wind had continued to be fierce, the rain had 
continued intermittently, and we were cold.&nbsp; It was wonderful to be out of 
the noise of the wind.&nbsp; We sat on the bench, ate our lunch sandwiches 
slowly, and had a luxurious rest.</p>

<p class="auto-style12">Not much later, we came to the stepping stones over the 
River Braint.&nbsp; We had seen pictures of these, and they looked like great 
fun.&nbsp; Maybe it was the wet rocks, coupled with strong gusts of wind?&nbsp; 
For some reason, we worried.&nbsp; The space between rocks looked enormous.&nbsp; 
Here are before and after photos, and it all looks perfectly benign.&nbsp; You 
don't see our shaking knees.</p>

<p class="auto-style12">Soon after we went through some fields of cows with 
calves (they distrusted us, but decided to let us pass), we were back at the 
shore for our final few miles.</p>
<p class="auto-style13">
<img alt="" height="387" src="wIMG_3601.jpg" width="1080" /></p>

much pleasurable walking.&nbsp; We recommend Anglesey!</p>
