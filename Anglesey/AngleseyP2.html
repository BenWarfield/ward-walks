<p class="auto-style12">After four or five miles of mostly farmland, and the 
hilltop of Brydd Arthur, the path headed down a lane toward Red Wharf Bay.</p>

<img alt="" height="675" src="wIMG_3393.jpg" width="900" /></p>

<p class="auto-style12">Red Wharf Bay is long.&nbsp; It was five or six miles of 
walking around the bay, sometimes on the sand, sometimes up above, sometimes 
through dunes, and sometimes through marshy areas.&nbsp; In the photo below, we 
were on a sea wall for a quarter-mile or so.</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_3394.jpg" width="720" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">We crossed several stone bridges:</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="542" src="wIMG_3395.jpg" width="1346" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">and after a short flower-filled woods path we emerged at 
the Ship Inn.&nbsp; We knew it was coming, and we happily stopped for a beer and 
a picnic lunch.</p>

<p class="auto-style12">The afternoon brought more pleasant walking, sometimes 
above the water </p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="523" src="wIMG_3402.jpg" width="900" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">and sometimes on the shore-line.</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="594" src="wIMG_3404.jpg" width="896" />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style12">We relaxed in our B&amp;B in Moelfre, enjoying the view out 
of our bedroom window:</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_3411.jpg" width="720" />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style12">Someone we had chatted with earlier in the afternoon, 
when we had said that we were going to Moelfre, told us about the lifeboat 
launch at the Moelfre RNLI station at 6:30.&nbsp; This was to be a special 
occasion, as the lifeboat station has been recently rebuilt, and it was still in 
the testing phase.&nbsp; We got there at 6:30, just in time to see the boat zoom 
down the slipway.</p>
<p class="auto-style14">

<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="392" src="wIMG_3414.jpg" width="900" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">Back here at home, I looked on the web for more 
information on this launching.&nbsp; I was amazed to find some pictures taken by 
a professional photographer, Brian Tuohey, who took his pictures at exactly the 
same time as I.&nbsp; And you can see the two of us!</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="720" src="lifeboat.jpg" width="960" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">To show a rather typical dinner, here we are eating fish 
and chips at a pub in Moelfre.</p>

		several "shouts" a day on summer weekends.<br />
		<br />
		The next day as we were leaving town, we walked for a bit with an older 
		woman, and we chatted.&nbsp; It turned out her brother had been coxswain 
		of the lifeboat after Dic Evans.<br />

<p class="auto-style12">An hour later, we came to another of the four outdoor 
paintings, this one at Lligwy Beach.</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="647" src="wIMG_3425.jpg" width="1080" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">As we walked around the bay, the flowers seemed 
particularly cheerful and beautiful.</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="675" src="wIMG_3426.jpg" width="900" /></p>

<img alt="" height="675" src="wIMG_3434.jpg" width="900" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">For two or three miles we were walking around the Dulas 
Estuary, mostly though farms.&nbsp; And of course through sheep.</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="381" src="wIMG_3437.jpg" width="720" /></p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="532" src="wIMG_3442.jpg" width="900" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">A few miles along the coast brought us to Point Lynas.&nbsp; 
Here our general direction changed.&nbsp; We had been walking mostly northwest.&nbsp; 
Now we began walking generally west, across the north side of the island.&nbsp; 
For centuries this point has been a treacherous spot for ships heading toward 
Liverpool.&nbsp; A beacon was built here in 1779, and this lighthouse dates from 
1835.&nbsp; Here's a look back toward the lighthouse on Point Lynas, after we 
had passed it. </p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="675" src="wIMG_3450.jpg" width="900" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">
A couple of miles along, we happily stopped for coffee (and warming up) in a cafe in 
Amlwch.&nbsp; Another four miles of up and down coastal walking brought us to 
Porth Wen.&nbsp; This is a bay with abandoned brick works, which in times past 
produced silica bricks from quartzite quarried nearby.</p>

<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="370" src="wIMG_3452.jpg" width="1080" /></p>

<img alt="" height="269" src="wIMG_20150429_140111311.jpg" width="720" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">Then followed another several miles of coastal walking, 
almost constantly up or down - though here was a level section where I took a 
couple of pictures.</p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_3458.jpg" width="720" /></p>
<p class="auto-style14">
<img alt="" height="522" src="wIMG_3461.jpg" width="720" /></p>
<p class="auto-style12">Then onward to spend the night in the attractive village 
of Cemaes. </p>
