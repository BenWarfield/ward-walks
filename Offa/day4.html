<h4>Monmouth to Llanvetherine</h4>

<p>After another late start (we talked a lot with Iris while she
cooked breakfast and while we ate), we left Monmouth on
&#147;Watery Lane&#148;.&nbsp; Then came mostly fields, with
occasional woods.&nbsp; At one stile we faced a field with
longhorn cattle.&nbsp; We took a deep breath, crossed the stile,
and went past them.&nbsp;<a href="LonghornStileBig.jpg"

didn&#146;t pay any attention to us at all, and I breathed a sigh
of relief.&nbsp; We got to the other side of the (big) field, and
hunted and hunted for a way out of it.&nbsp; We couldn&#146;t
remember having seen a path sign on the stile.&nbsp; We groaned,
and walked back through the cattle to the stile &#150; and found
that it did have the path sign on it, after all!&nbsp; So back we
went for the third time, past the cattle, who undoubtedly were
wondering what the heck was going on.&nbsp; This time we found a
stile, hidden behind some trees at the far corner of the&nbsp;<a

width="247" height="160"></a>field. </p>

<p>We continued through more fields, some with cows, some newly
planted (the &quot;path&quot; was the narrow strip between rows
of plants), one an enormous apple orchard with thousands of new
young trees in straight rows.&nbsp; We passed the church with the
wonderful name &quot;Llanfihangel Ystern Llywern&quot;, meaning
&quot;St.Michael's of the Fiery Meteor&quot;, and later stopped
in to see the church of St.Teilo at Llantilio Crossenny.&nbsp;
Outside the village inn, the Hostry, we chatted with two men from
the Netherlands, whom we would be seeing off and on for the next
several days.&nbsp; Fred and Theo were camping, doing the first
half of the Offa's Dyke Path. </p>

<p>Not too much later we came to the White Castle.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a

width="200" height="280"></a>Apparently it had once had a white
plaster coating; hence the name.&nbsp; It's a 12th century
century castle built by the Norman Marcher Lords.&nbsp; We
wandered around in it for awhile before heading off for our
B&amp;B farmhouse not far away.&nbsp; It's an old farm, built in
1420.&nbsp; Its name is &quot;Tre-Rhew&quot;, which means
&quot;Home of Frost&quot;.&nbsp; The name is old, too, but Trevor
said that it's still applicable -- it stays cold and frosty there
long after other places have warmed up.&nbsp; We were there by
early afternoon, and Anne fixed us tea and cookies.&nbsp; We
relaxed, watched TV and read.&nbsp; It had been drizzling all
afternoon but now was pouring rain, so we were glad to accept
when Trevor stuck his head in the lounge and offered to drive us
to the pub for dinner.&nbsp; When he dropped us off, he said
&quot;Tell Paul to ring me when you're finished&quot;; we took
him up on that, too.&nbsp; We enjoyed our dinner (mushroom and
nut fettucini for me, Tikki Marsala for Thann), and the pub (the
King's Arms) in general..&nbsp; It was all very pleasant! </p>
