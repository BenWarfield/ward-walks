<h4>Hay-on-Wye to Kington</h4>

<p>We crossed the Wye Bridge and then walked beside the river for
a pleasant stretch. After that came more fields, and a muddy path
through a dingle. A &quot;dingle&quot; is a deep, wooded valley
or dell, usually quite pleasant. <img src="FlowersOnLane.jpg"

were several miles of walking on small lanes, almost invariably
bordered with banks of wildflowers. There was an annoying part,
where we guessed that a farmer didn't like walkers. The assigned
path was at the edge of the field, but there was a prickly hedge
to our left and a single-wire &quot;fence&quot; to our right -
and the path underfoot was tilted and rough! <a

vspace="4" width="160" height="197"></a>That field seemed
endless. Then after we finally came to the road and crossed it,
there was another difficult field. It must have been the same
farmer! This field was plowed within a foot of the edge, and
there were trees with low branches along the side of the field.
Bad person! But to make up for that farmer, there was the one at
Hill Farm who put up a sign beside a water tap, inviting Offa's
Dyke walkers to help themselves:</p>

<p>There <a href="MonkeyPuzzleBig.jpg" target="MonkeyPuzzle"><img
src="MonkeyPuzzle.jpg" align="left" border="1" hspace="8"
vspace="4" width="249" height="160"></a>were two hill-climbs. The
first was Disgwylfa Hill, pleasantly open with wide views. The
second was the Hergest Ridge. On this one there was a wonderful
long walk on top of the ridge, with great views, and soft
comfortable grass underfoot. The skylarks were singing, and we
felt great. Thann particularly liked the grove of newly-planted
monkey-puzzle trees.</p>

<p>In Kington, we stayed with a young couple we liked, who lived
on the outskirts of town. We went into town for dinner at The
Swan, and had a pleasant walk back, through the town and then
along a path beside Back Brook.</p>
