<h4>Pool Quay to Nantmawr</h4>

<p>When we said our goodbyes, Leslie very kindly gave us more of
the good cake, as well as bananas and fruit juice cartons. We
were back beside the Severn for a good while, again on flood
control embankments. The Breidden Hill was on our right, and we
were sorry to see it being eaten away by quarrying. We came back
to the Montgomery Canal for several very enjoyable miles. There
was a swan family, as well as other groups of swans. There were
interesting locks. There was an aquaduct taking the canal over
the Vrynwy River.</p>

<p>And finally there were the views of Llanymynech Hill and the
Heritage Site kiln chimney ahead of us. We were eager to get to
Llanymynech. A few months earlier, Penny had been there for a
week, with a group of conservation volunteers. They were working
at the Heritage Site there, doing improvements and learning at
the same time. Several days had been spent on hedge-laying, and
Penny had told us how to find the newly laid hedge, and &quot;her&quot;
section in particular. We were extremely excited when we managed
to follow her directions and find the hedge! <img

hspace="7" vspace="4" width="160" height="251">I took pictures,
to show her that the new shoots were growing well. We saw a woman
who was studying a wildflower. I asked her what it was, since it
was one we had been seeing. Then I mentioned that our daughter
Penny had been here in March, with the BTCV group. She matter-of-factly
said &quot;Yes, I met Penny.&quot; She had even taken a picture
of Penny for the local newspaper! She offered to show us the big
kiln, which is the centerpiece of the Heritage Site. This was a
unique sort of kiln. It was an enormous cave-like structure,
roughly 60 by 120 feet. They kept fires going constantly, moving
from one section of the kiln to another. They burned the
limestone to make agricultural lime. The brick chimney for the
kiln is more than 100 feet tall, and is impressively high when
you stand beside it and look up.</p>

<p>We ate our lunch while sitting on the steps (in the photo) up
to a traditional kiln, wandered around a bit more, and then
finally left the Heritage Site, still feeling very exhilarated
and happy. We next went up Llanymynech Hill (which is disfigured
by the quarrying, but has extensive views), past a golf course (where
we talked with some men on the 4th tee and tried to avoid being
hit as we walked near the green), down the other side through a
woods (stopping to admire the purple orchids, which like
limestone soil), up again along several miles of lanes with good
views, to our B&amp;B in Nantmawr. We took off our gaiters and
boots before even knocking at the door, since it was clearly a
very clean, tidy house. Our room was downstairs, with sliding
doors out into their very interesting back garden and yard. The
yard sloped steeply down to two large ponds which Bill and June
kept stocked for people to fish in. A disused quarry railway line
also ended there! </p>
