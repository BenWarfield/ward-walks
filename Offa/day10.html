<h4>Knighton to Little Brompton Farm</h4>

unfortunately also a wet day. We put on our rain gear again. We
started off, after saying &quot;good-bye&quot; to Dana Simmons,
up Panpunton Hill, and then up Cwn Sanaham Hill. That was fine,
and we had good views. But by the time we headed downhill, the
rain both from this morning and collectively from the whole week
had managed to make difficult, slippery paths. It was frequently
slow going. The day was one of continuous ups and downs. But on
the good side, we had the dyke with us all day, and lots and lots
of hawthorns -- pretty, even in the drizzle! <img

width="160" height="238">We were surprised on this day, as on
others, at the damage that's being done to the dyke by burrowing
animals. They've made enormous holes. You definitely have to be
careful where you put your feet!</p>

<p>We saw no other walkers all day. The only other person we saw
was The Photographer. When we came around the corner at a
crossroads of little lanes, we saw a car parked. A man jumped
out, saying &quot;You must be the Americans!&quot; It turned out
that he was writing an article for the Guardian about Offa's
Dyke, and wanted pictures of walkers on it. Our friends Brian and
Phil had gone by earlier, and he had taken some pictures of them.
(I don't know why that wasn't enough for him.) They told him that
an American couple would be coming by, so he waited for us. For
15 minutes or so, while we walked along the path on top the dyke,
he ran along down beside it, snapping photos and talking with us.
We found out when the article was to be published, which was
about a week later. We were all set to be Famous Stars, but the
article didn't have any photos at all! Maybe the fact that it was
raining and he had to keep wiping off his lens did something to
the quality of the pictures. (It couldn't possibly be that we
weren't ideal subjects...)</p>

Little Brompton Farm, were very helpful, as we tried to dry out
our wet clothes. The rain clothes work pretty well, but you still
have wet, muddy rain trousers, gaiters, jackets, and boots to put
or hang somewhere. We were glad to see Brian and Phil there, too.
