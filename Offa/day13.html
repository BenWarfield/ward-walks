<h4>Nantmawr to Pentre</h4>

<p>We started off steeply uphill, to the hilltop called Moelydd.
We enjoyed the views in all directions, and wondered about a
cloud with rain visibly coming down from it. Thann thought it was
going a different direction. I thought it was coming our way, and
put on my jacket. Fortunately, he was right! The path then went
through many farms. In one farm field we saw a very young lamb,
still with its umbilical cord attached. It seemed to be unhappy,
and came to us for help. Its mother started to come over, and the
lamb ran away. We decided we were causing problems, so went on.
We soon saw the farmer, and told him about the situation. He said
the lamb had been born the day before, and joked about the
problems of lambs, and how he didn't want them but that's what
happens when you have loose women and a tup jumps the fence. But
he laughed and said he'd go check on them.</p>

<p>It was Spring Bank Holiday Monday<a

width="241" height="160"></a> and a beautiful day, so everyone
was out. In Trefonen there was a road race. We chatted with a
fellow who was standing and waiting for the first runners, who
were about to appear, he thought. We went on, and soon were
behind several groups of walkers, all going our direction. After
a bit we realized (from signs along the way) that they were doing
a &quot;charity walk&quot; for some Good Cause (money for
education in some third world country, I think it was). For a
couple of miles we were mixed up with these groups of cheerful
unhurried walkers. We went down past an old mill at Llanforda,
then up through Craig Forda Woods, and then through the &quot;Old
Race Course&quot; on top the hill - now a common area for
grazing. In rough grass just after this, we saw a mother pheasant
with her family. She was very worried by our presence, making
lots of noise and running around, trying to gather up her chicks.

width="230" height="160"></a>On Selattyn Hill we met a couple of
women whom we would see for the next few days. They were school
teachers (one retired), using the holiday week to do the last
third of the Offa's Dyke Path.<img src="NearCragnant.jpg"
align="left" hspace="8" vspace="4" width="238" height="160"> They
had done the previous thirds on holidays in other years. </p>

<p>The path continued to be pleasant, as we walked over hills and
down green lanes, finally seeing Chirk Castle on a hilltop ahead.
Our goal was to get there before 4:30, because that was the last
time for entry into the castle. Our host that morning in Nantmawr
had told us about other guests of theirs who had taken too long
to get to Chirk, arriving after 5. What we <em>really</em>
wanted, though, was to get to the Tea Room before it closed!
Fortunately we were there before 4, and had a wonderful tea with
several big, rich, delicious scones and cakes for each of us. We
came out of the tea room, which was in the bottom of one of the
towers of the castle, into the castle courtyard. Thann spotted a
doorway where they were selling ice cream cones, and had to have
one!</p>

<p>We went out to the gardens, for which Chirk is most well
known. The first thing one sees is a large garden of trimmed
boxwoods. We went through that, and into the formal flower
gardens, and enjoyed our unhurried wandering.</p>

<p>After we walked out the castle drive to the small road that we
were to walk on next, we stopped to put down our packs and take
off our jackets. We were <img src="LastOfDyke.jpg" align="right"
hspace="12" vspace="3" width="240" height="342">on the grassy
area beside the road, which at that point had a sharp bend. We
didn't pay much attention when we heard a car approaching the
curve too fast. But we <em>did</em> pay attention when the car
flew off the road and onto the grass beside us! Some startled
(and shocked) teenagers turned and looked at us out of the back
window, and then the car roared off again.</p>

<p>Not long before the end of our day's walk, our books told us
that we were seeing the last of Offa's Dyke itself. We were sad;
we had become quite attached to it! This final piece of it was
appropriately topped by an oak and a hawthorn.</p>

<p>We stayed at Sun Cottage, in Pentre. This is a very
interesting house, which had been an inn in the 17th century -
possibly earlier. Brenda and Joe were very kind hosts. Maybe we
should have said &quot;no, thanks&quot; to the tea, since we had
had a lot of it already at Chirk. (I did in fact have trouble
getting to sleep, an atypical occurence on the walk.) Joe drove
us to the club house at the local golf course for our dinner; he
always does this for his guests since their village pub has
closed. We walked back afterwards, mostly along the canal
towpath. </p>
