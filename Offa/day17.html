<h4>Bodfari to Prestatyn</h4>

<p>Our final day was unfortunately a very wet one. No pictures
till these two at the very end, because my camera stayed packed
up. We had to walk through quite a few very muddy plowed up
fields, sinking deep with each step. I skidded and fell down
twice.<img src="Prestatyn.jpg" align="left" hspace="9" vspace="4"

the time we walked down the High Street in Prestatyn. <img

width="315" height="160">But we were cheered by the sight of a
book store. We were finally free to buy books! (Actually, we had
bought four or five along the way, ones that we really didn't
think we'd ever see anywhere else.) We stuck our heads in the
shop to ask when they closed. They were going to close in an hour,
and we figured we wouldn't have time to get to the B&amp;B, dry
off, and get back in time. The shop people were very kind and
said to come on in. So we put our packs in a corner and walked
very carefully between bookshelves, and wound up with a stack of
wonderful novels and historical novels set in Wales! Just what we
wanted!</p>

<p>We then walked down to the official ending place, took
pictures of it, found our guest house, and cleaned up and dried
off. Dinner at the &quot;Offa's Tavern&quot; pub seemed the
appropriate place to finish the walk!</p>
