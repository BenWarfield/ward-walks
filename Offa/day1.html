<h4>Arrival Day</h4>

<p>On our arrival day, we took a bus from Heathrow to
Chepstow.&nbsp; We walked down through the old city gate to our
guest house across from the castle.&nbsp; After taking our
backpacks up to our room and putting on our boots, we set
out.&nbsp; First we visited the castle, which is an impressive
ruin. It was built at various times;&nbsp; much of the castle
built in 1067 by a friend of William the Conqueror is still
standing.&nbsp; Most of the rest was added in the 13th century. <br>

On Rennie's Bridge, Chepstow Castle behind country boundary
marker </p>

<p>After admiring the castle, we crossed the Wye on the Rennie
Bridge, thus walking back into England.&nbsp; We were impressed
by how low the river was.&nbsp; It's tidal, and rises and falls
about 50 feet at Chepstow.&nbsp; We walked the two miles down to
Sedbury Cliffs, the &quot;official&quot; start of the Offa's Dyke
Path.&nbsp; On our way we crossed the first of the estimated 650
stiles on the route!&nbsp; We also did our first stretch of
walking on the dyke itself.&nbsp; We were surprised to find that
the path goes along the actual dyke; we had thought that it would
be protected for historical conservation purposes.&nbsp; But
there were many miles, as it turned out, of walking on top the
dyke.&nbsp; Another first that afternoon:&nbsp; we had our first
view of the spectacular show of hawthorns in bloom.&nbsp; They're
small trees (or big hedge bushes) totally covered in white
blossoms. <br>

First walk on Offa's Dyke and first hawthorns </p>

<p>Back in Chepstow, we stopped in Tesco and bought apples and
prepackaged salads and took them back to our room for our
dinner.&nbsp; Then, after repacking our backpacks, bleary-eyed
from lack of sleep, we went to bed. </p>
