<h4>Little Brompton Farm to Pool Quay</h4>

<p>Our rain jackets went on and off all day long, in the rain and
then sun. We didn't go to Montgomery (near the beginning of the
day) or Welshpool (near the end of the day), both towns just a
mile or so to the west. We did enjoy the views of Powis Castle,
near Welshpool, in the distance. As we walked on the track
through Leighton Woods we read that there were more monkey-puzzle
trees there. We looked around and couldn't find them. After
giving up and going on, we happened to look up. We were standing
under them; we hadn't realized that they could be so tall! <a

Ring hill fort, an iron age fortification. In Buttington Bridge,
we crossed the Severn, seeing it for the first time since the
begining of our walk. We scurried across the bridge in a gap
between cars, since there's no walkway, and the cars were
whizzing by. We walked beside the Severn for a while, some of the
time on a flood embankment. <img src="SwingBridge.jpg"

we came to the very pleasant Montgomery Canal. There's a
wonderful towpath lined with wildflowers. There was a pretty
little swing bridge. After just over a mile, we came to a set of
locks, and turned down off the canal to Pool Quay.</p>

<p>We were staying in Pool Quay, at a B&amp;B named &quot;Severn
View&quot;. When we came to the A road, it looked as if the
village were to the right, so we turned that direction. It had
just two minutes before started raining in earnest, so we were
sort of eager to find our place. After one or two houses, a man
standing in front of his house said to us &quot;There's the
Severn and here's the View&quot;. That was our introduction to
Amos, a great fellow. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there. They
fixed us tea and gave us big slices of fruitcake that Leslie had
just bought at the church fair, down the road. <a

tried to make a fire for us to dry us off and warm us up, but
apparently birds had built a nest in the chimney. The house
quickly filled with smoke, so we had to open everything to air it
out. Amos groaned at the prospect of cleaning out the chimney,
which he had had to do for the same reason not long before. We
went up to our room (suite, really) for showers, and happened to
look out the window at an incredible rainbow. It framed the
Breidden Hills beyond the Severn. Spectacular! Amos and Leslie
fixed us an excellent dinner, with excellent wine. Amos talked
some about his job as a helicopter instructor and Leslie and I
talked some about our families. It was a very pleasant evening.</p>
