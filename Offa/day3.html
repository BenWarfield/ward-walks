<h4 align="left">Tintern to Monmouth</h4>

<p align="left">We made a late start, after spending a long time
talking at breakfast with the other guests, a retired GP and his
wife, from Kent.&nbsp; We had a very pleasant morning walking
through meadows beside the Wye. <br>

<p>After the town of Bigsweir we went back up into woods, and had
several miles again on Offa's Dyke, with wild garlic around
us.&nbsp; There was a pretty view down to the Wye at Redbrook, <a

align="right" hspace="9" vspace="10" width="197" height="160"></a>before
we descended to it.&nbsp; We sat on a bench on the village green
to eat our sandwiches, before checking out the old disused
railway bridge which we had seen from above.&nbsp; After that it
was up to Kymin, a hilltop with a curious &quot;Naval
Temple&quot; celebrating victories of the Royal Navy, and then
back down (the 800 feet) to Monmouth.&nbsp; From a phone box in
Agincourt Square (named in honor of Henry V, who was born in
Monmouth), we telephoned Iris Jones, our B&amp;B hostess.&nbsp;<a

width="240" height="160"></a>She had said to do this, and when we
phoned she said she'd meet us at the Green Dragon, a pub just
beyond the Monnow Bridge.&nbsp; She actually found us as I was
photographing the bridge, and she walked us to her house on a
path we'd have had trouble finding.&nbsp; We sat for awhile at
her kitchen table, drinking orange juice and eating cookies, and
talking with Iris and her daughter, granddaughter, and
great-granddaughter (they were just visiting her).&nbsp; We then
walked back to town, again crossing and admiring the Monnow
Bridge, with its 13th century fortified gatehouse.&nbsp; We had
dinner at the Green Dragon and then walked around, seeing the
scanty remains of the castle where Henry V was born, and enjoying
the town. </p>
