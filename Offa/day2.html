<h4>Chepstow to Tintern</h4>

<p><img src="TutshillTower.jpg" align="left" hspace="8"
vspace="8" width="284" height="200">We enjoyed chatting with our
host at breakfast, learning about how strong the Welsh language
movement is.&nbsp; We stopped by Tesco for lunch materials and by
the Post Office for stamps and set off back across the Rennie
Bridge.&nbsp;The River Wye separates England and Wales for many
miles, and our walk started off on the English side.&nbsp; As we
left town, we were in a field of buttercups and daisies, as we
would be many more times.&nbsp; Here, though, there was a
medieval tower, of unknown origin, sitting in back of the
house.&nbsp;<img src="WintoursLeap.jpg" align="right" hspace="8"
vspace="16" width="280" height="200">We soon were climbing high
above the river on the top of cliffs, with striking views down to
the Wye, far below.&nbsp; There's a good view from&quot;Wintour's
Leap&quot;, where a Royalist is supposed to have jumped with his
horse and survived while fleeing Cromwell's Parliamentarians.</p>

<p>Much of the walk was through woods, which were damp and
permeated with the smell (which we enjoyed) of wild garlic.&nbsp;
The woods were carpeted with the white flowers, and we were
overwhelmed by the beauty.&nbsp; We were again walking beside or
on top of Offa's Dyke.&nbsp;<a href="WildGarlic2Big.jpg"

hspace="8" vspace="8" width="244" height="163"></a>We came to our
first view, down through a gap in the trees, of Tintern
Abbey.&nbsp; We were again overwhelmed!&nbsp; What a sight it
was, way below us, beside the winding river!&nbsp;We stopped and
ate our lunch at the &quot;Devil's Pulpit&quot;, a big rock
column from which the Devil was supposed to have preached to the
monks in the abbey far below.&nbsp; After lunch, we continued to
walk in the woods, on the dyke, surrounded by wild garlic in
bloom, with occasional glimpses <a href="TinternFromWoodsBig.jpg"
target="TinternFromWoods"><img src="TinternFromWoods.jpg"
align="right" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="261" height="140"></a>of
the abbey.&nbsp; At a footpath sign marked for Tintern, we turned
down the hillside.&nbsp; When we got to the abbey, we went in and
spent a happy, leisurely couple of hours.&nbsp; The sun was
shining and everything was wonderful! <br>
<br>
Our B&amp;B was the &quot;Wye Barn&quot;, a 450-year old house
beside the Wye, quite near the abbey.&nbsp; <a

had dinner at the pub, &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot;,&nbsp;
which had a curious spring-fed pool in the dining room. The road
we followed to the pub had the Wye on the right and a hillside on
the left. On the way back to our B&amp;B, we could hear the
springs rushing down behind the retaining wall at the base of the
hill. We found holes through which we could reach and touch the
springs! </p>
