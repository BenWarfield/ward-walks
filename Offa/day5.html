<h4>Llanvertherine to Llanthony</h4>

<p>The views this morning were of rolling hills with fields
bordered with hawthorns in bloom. We kept stopping to admire the
beauty.<a href="FieldWalkingBig.jpg" target="FieldWalking"><img

width="247" height="160"></a> For several hours we went up and
down fields, across streams by footbridges, over lots of stiles,
and along lanes bordered on both sides by wildflowers of all
colors (but mostly hedge parsley with its white blossoms). <a

width="221" height="160"></a>At the top of a hill we went through
a gate beside the church at Llangatock Lingoed. As I took a
picture of the church (pretty, in its wildflower covered
churchyard), we heard a &quot;Hello!&quot;. It was our friends
Fred and Theo, who had camped there, and were just getting their
gear back in their packs. They had had a problem finding a place
to stay. Because they were so wet from all the rain, they had
wanted to stay in a B&amp;B or inn, but the inn they had tried
was filled with a group called the &quot;Hashhouse
Harriers&quot;. Fred and Theo had eaten with this very cheerful
bunch of men, who said they were &quot;drinking men with a
weakness for running&quot;. They drank a lot and then ran, to get
over their hangovers - or something like that! After a few more
fields, we came out onto a little road, and came across Paul, the
owner of the King's Arms, where we had eaten the evening before.
We had noticed that he had several pictures of horses on the pub
walls, so weren't surprised that he was watching two beautiful
horses in the next field. It was a mother and daughter, and he
told us that he planned to race the younger one, a two-year-old.
They're descendants of Northern Dancer.</p>

<p>After walking up through the field with Paul's horses, we soon
came to a hilltop and our first <a href="HatterallViewBig.jpg"

alt="Click here for larger version." align="left" hspace="9"
vspace="9" width="239" height="160"></a>view of the Hatterall
Ridge, our next objective. This is the eastern ridge of the Black
Mountains. Our route first went down to the town of Pandy, and
then started climbing. It was easy enough getting up the steepest
part, to where it was just a gentle rise on a pleasant path.<img

width="213" height="160"> The views off the ridge to east and
west were both striking. To the east was farmland - fields and
meadows. To the west was the remote and beautiful Vale of Ewyas.
We stopped to eat lunch in a little hollowed out dip, to get out
of the wind. In fact, the wind was so strong that a little later
it blew off my pack cover. We had been chatting with some other
walkers (they were staying in their caravan in Pandy for a
two-week holiday, walking on the ridges every day) and had gone
on ahead. Fortunately I heard them shout (I just barely heard
them, over the roaring wind) and turned around. They were
pointing to my pack cover, which had blown off, but was
momentarily stuck on a heather plant. We all ran toward it, and
they managed to snag it before it blew away again.</p>

of ridge walking, we came to the place where we planned to leave
the Offa's Dyke Path and turn left, down into the Vale of Ewyas.
We had read about the possibility of spending the night in the
ruins of an abbey, and that sounded intriguing! Llanthony Abbey
had been built in the early 12th century, but had had problems
even before Henry VIII. Raiders had chased most of the monks
away, and then &quot;the wildness, isolation and grim Welsh
neighbors oppressed the spirit of the monks who remained&quot;,
according to our book. The abbey suffered again at the
Dissolution, but in the 18th century someone bought the property
and transformed the south tower and prior's quarters into a lodge
for shooting parties. It's now a &quot;hotel&quot; - but not of
the standard sort. We were totally delighted by our whole time
there. We were excited as we approached the abbey, with the
thought that we'd be staying there overnight. There were a good
many visitors there -- mostly in the bar, in the crypt which was
the bottom floor of the prior's lodging. The young man behind the
bar took us up to our room, up a small circular staircase with
narrow stone steps. It was a big room, with a big four-poster bed
with a canopy. We loved looking out the window into the nave of
the abbey. We watched a bunch of children playing something that
looked like kick-the-can, hiding behind the pillars and in the
transcept areas. What an experience! We went back outside and
explored &quot;our&quot; abbey, and then had dinner in
&quot;our&quot; dining room. We were the only guests. It was
great!</p>
