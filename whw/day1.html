24</u></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Having spent the previous night in
Glasgow, we took the twenty minute train ride to Milngavie, a
suburb of Glasgow, for the start of the walk. We had decided to
have two duffle bags carried by a luggage transport service, </font><a

that we all had light packs to carry. We left our bags with the
Travel-lite people, shopped for sandwiches for lunch and some
other odds and ends, posed for a photo at the starting obelisk,
and set off. </font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The first part wound through
pleasant park land. We had to work our way through and past a
large walking group that had started out just ahead of us. Penny
enjoyed chatting with them. We saw them off and on for several
days. After crossing a major road, we had our first encounter
with a bucket of disinfectant, put there for walkers to clean
their boots and rid them of foot and mouth disease contamination.
There was a stretch called &quot;Tinker's Loan&quot;, an old
lane, now grassy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">We had hoped to stop in for a tour
of the Glengoyne Distillery, which is in sight across a field.
But signs had said that we should stay on the path, and to get to
the distillery we would have had to cross a field with sheep, so
we thought that we shouldn't. Great sadness. But after not too
long we came to the Beach Tree Inn, where we had cold, refreshing
drinks. Thann and Alida particularly liked their St. Andrews Ale.
We lingered there, since we had already finished 2/3 of the
mileage for the day, and it was only noon.</font><a

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">A funny episode occurred while we
ate our lunch. We were sitting up on a concrete structure, one of
many similar ones along this stretch of former railway line. A
cow behind us started approaching, and Penny recalled the fact
that Thann seems to have a remarkable magnetism for cows. Then we
all suddenly noticed a herd of cows on a far away hilltop as they
started moving toward us. </font><a href="CowsBig.jpg"
target="WHW"><img src="Cows.jpg" align="right" hspace="6"
vspace="8" width="294" height="175"></a><font face="Book Antiqua">They
began gathering speed, and soon were crashing into each other in
their great rush to come to us! We were very glad that there was
a fence between them and us! They stood leaning against the fence
for a good while before sadly leaving. We were sorry to
disappoint them!</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">We arrived at Gateside Lodge near
Drymen just as it started raining. No one was home, as it was
still early afternoon, but there was a bench in front of the
house under an eave; we sat and read guidebooks while we waited.
After a while, a couple of young schoolboys walked by up the
lane, stopped, and called back to an unseen friend &quot;You've
got walkers!&quot;, making it sound like some sort of disease. A
few minutes after that, a shy little boy opened the front door
and invited us in, to sit in the living room and wait for his
mother. Not much later, she arrived and showed us our rooms. We
felt quite content and comfortable there. For dinner, we walked
the half-mile to Drymen, and ate at the Clachan Inn, said to be
the oldest licensed pub in Scotland. We were at a table beside a
threesome of English walkers of about Thann's and my age, whom we
saw off and on for the rest of the walk.</font></p>
