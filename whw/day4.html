<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><u>Inverarnan to Crianlarich -
Monday, May 28</u></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The other couple at breakfast were
on their 13th walking of the West Highland Way! But our main
memory of breakfast is the conversation with Frank, our host. He
was very funny (sometimes ribbing us about what we had brought in
our packs)! We set off happily, back across the river to re-join
the Way. We talked a little with our penny whistle friends. These
two women are both musicians, and had brought a penny whistle to
play while they walked. We heard them off and on for several
days, ahead of us or behind, as we passed or were passed by them
on occasion. At one appropriate point, we heard behind us the
penny whistle rendition of &quot;The Grand Old Duke of
York&quot;. They had stayed at the Drovers, but were glad that
they were in the newer annex. It apparently was passable; the old
building we were sure would not have been. </font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">This section of the route goes up
Glen Falloch, beside the River Falloch . There were pretty
waterfalls and cascades down to our left. We were back in sheep
grazing country, as well as cuckoo territory. We enjoy hearing
cuckoos, although they're apparently rather nasty birds!</font></p>

        were excitedly anticipating the structure called a
        &quot;sheep creep&quot; in our guidebook. The book said
        it was &quot;strenuous&quot;. Well, our imaginations had
        exceeded the actual reality. It was just a short
        passageway under the railway embankment, where you had to
        walk in a squatting position. If it had been much longer,
        it might well have been strenuous...</font></td>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">After this we were again on one of
the old military roads. After the 1715 uprisings, the English
realized that they needed roads in order to have any success in
pacifying the Scots. General Wade and Major Caulfield were the
men most responsible for the roads, which were built from 1724
on, continuing after the 1745 rebellion. Since an important route
was the one from Glasgow to Fort William, much of the West
Highland Way uses what remains of these roads. They are usually
stony tracks, though sometimes the stones have been covered with
dirt and grass.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">We said goodbye to our pennywhistle
friends at the top of the two spur routes down to Crianlarich. It
was the end of the bank holiday weekend, so they had to go back
to work, and were taking the path directly down to the train
station. We were also going down to Crianlarich, to spend the
night, but Frank had told us that the more direct route to our
B&amp;B was down the Bogle Glen path. </font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">We settled into our excellent guest
house and then walked back into town. We had lunch at the
&quot;station tea room&quot;, shopped in the one little shop
(where we ran into our threesome of Brits again), and managed to
squander the afternoon doing very little. We enjoyed our dinner
at the &quot;Rod and Reel&quot;, and then all of us except Alida
(who wanted to watch a movie on TV) played a board game in the
lounge of the guest house.</font></p>
