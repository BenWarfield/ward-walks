<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><u>Kinlochleven to Fort William -
Friday, June 1</u></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">At the end of the day we saw the
weather forecast: &quot;gale force winds, heavy rain, 32 degrees
at 3000 feet&quot;. We could attest to the first two - the wind
and rain were straight into our faces. As for the third, we
weren't at 3000 feet, but our 40 degrees didn't feel much warmer.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">We were walking with hordes of
people. It looked as if no matter which day people had started,
and no matter how fast or slowly they walked, they all finished
at Fort William on this particular day. The horde, of course,
included almost everyone we had met - the English threesome, the
walking group, some Norwegians, a couple of Dutchmen - everyone!</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">It was a long, wet day. For the
first few hours there was no privacy, so when we came to a woods,
dozens of people suddenly disappeared behind the trees! Because
of the rain, lunch places were non-existant. Lots of people
stopped in a couple of ruined farm buildings, but the buildings
had no roofs! We found a pretty spot by a footbridge over a
stream, got out our packed lunches, and were immediately attacked
by midges! Toward the end of the day, where we were supposed to
be seeing the enormous bulk of Ben Nevis, we saw only the bottom
hundred or so yards. But even that was impressive! And needless
to say, we were exuberant when we came to the &quot;End of the
West Highland Way&quot; sign at the edge of Fort William.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">We liked our guest house, which was
part B&amp;B, part studio. On the walls were paintings by the
owner, who unfortunately was away for the weekend. For dinner, we
went to McTavish's Kitchen. This is geared for tourists but
pleasantly low-key. There's a floor show with bagpipes,
accordion, and dancing. We thoroughly enjoyed the evening!</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The next day we took the West
Highland Line train back to Glasgow. The route starts by going
north of Ben Nevis. Since the sun was shining brilliantly (in
stark contrast with the day before!) the views were excellent. We
passed by the edge of Rannoch Moor, and could look across it
toward Glencoe. We went around the big horseshoe under Beinn
Dorain where we had waited so long to see a train reappear. After
that, we were near our path for a good while, and watched our
eight wonderful days rewinding before our eyes! </font></p>
