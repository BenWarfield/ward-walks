<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><u>Rowardennan to Inverarnan -
Sunday, May 26</u></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Izzy, Ivor, and Anchorage Cottage
were all much appreciated. The house is new, with all
conveniences. Izzy and Ivor were extremely kind and eager to make
us comfortable. Breakfast was enormous, with all the usual
selection, plus more. I especially liked the interesting cheeses
on oatcakes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">They ordered a taxi to take us back
to Rowardennan. We arrived at the same time as several other sets
of people (including Zoe and Jonathan) who had been brought there
from other B&amp;Bs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The path was a forest track for a
while, going uphill and down. We were finally rid of the road,
which stops at Rowardennan. After a short time the track became a
woods path, very enjoyable. The views were still beautiful, with
the lake to our left and a hillside to our right, often with
bluebells.</font></p>

        a little. The rain felt good, as the day was actually
        quite warm. We arrived at the Inversnaid Hotel after a
        few hours. A guidebook comments on how unexpected it is,
        &quot;a curious intermission in the Way's progress up the
        wild east shore&quot;. The road in to it from the east
        goes through the only gap in the mountains. We bought
        glasses of lemonade and sat down by the hotel's dock to
        eat our packed lunches. </font></td>

        bushes. After we passed the bothy at Doune (there are
        several bothies on the route, which are buildings left
        open for use by anyone), the path became more open. </font></td>

        wonderful event that we had been looking forward to with
        great anticipation: Andy appeared (with his camcorder!),
        coming down the path! He hadn't been able to leave work
        to join the rest of us at the start of the walk, but had
        flown to Glasgow, arriving this morning. He took the
        train up the west side of Loch Lomond, got off at the
        station which was closest to where we presumably were,
        found a ferry (a little motorboat) to take him across the
        lake, and searched up and down the path till he found us!
        Was that ever a joyful reunion!</font></td>

        <td><font face="Book Antiqua">When we came to Beinglas
        Farm, we stopped for ice cream, and said goodbye to Zoe
        and Jonathan, who were going on another six miles to
        Crianlarich for the night. We crossed the river in order
        to go into Inverarnan, where we were to spend the night
        at Rose Cottage. I think Inverarnan consists of little
        more than Rose Cottage, a restaurant called &quot;Stagger
        Inn&quot;, and the eccentric old Drovers Inn. We had read
        about the inn, so weren't surprised by its entry hall,
        but we still were delighted. There's a multitude of
        stuffed animals, including a big &quot;charging&quot;
        bear. The place was jammed with people, in several rooms.
        The fellows behind the bar, who also brought the food to
        the table, were funny looking, dressed in kilts, but very
        scruffy t-shirts and hiking boots.</font></td>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Everyone in the bar joined in the
jocular, heated discussion when Andy asked for an explanation of
the menu item &quot;vegetarian haggis&quot;. Someone suggested
that the sheep must have eaten vegetables. We had some as an
appetizer, at our funny table (the veneer was curling up so badly
it was hard to get a plate to sit level) under the crazy painting
on the wall (enormous black background, with the head of Mary,
Queen of Scots in the upper right corner and a beheaded head in
the lower left), next to the table that kept collapsing.
Interesting place, the Drovers!</font></p>
