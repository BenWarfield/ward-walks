<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><u>Drymen to Rowardennan - Saturday,
May 25</u></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">We enjoyed our breakfast while
chatting with the other guests, a young couple, Zoe and Jonathan,
from southern England. The sun was shining, and we felt
exhilarated as we started off up the hillside.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">We soon were on a path leading up
through gorse, toward Garadhban Forest. The forest track was
wide, and the woods were dark and cool. We saw the big walking
group again, but passed them when they stopped for a break. They
had stopped at the point where the first view of Loch Lomond
appears. It was also the point where there was a sign telling us
that Conic Hill was closed until the following day. Conic Hill is
closed to walkers for about a month each spring, during lambing
season. This month usually ends in mid-May, but this year the
closure was extended till the 27th, one day too late for us.
There's an alternate route, which we took, going down a farm lane
to the road and walking along it to Balmaha. We were again
covering ground a bit too fast - it had taken just two hours to
walk the 6.5 miles - so we stopped there for a mid-morning break,
at the Oak Tree Inn.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">After Balmaha, the route leads up a
little hill to a rocky area called Craigie Fort, where there's a
good view of Loch Lomond. The big group was spread out over the
rocks, so we went on, but we didn't lack for good views. As we
went down the other side of the hill, the sight of bluebells with
the lake beyond was stunning. After half an hour or so of very
pleasant lakeside walking, we stopped and ate lunch on the rocky
shore.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The path paralleled the minor road,
sometimes crossing it, sometimes by the lake and sometimes above
it. We were in woods most of the time, but there were large
sections where the trees (conifers) had all been felled. Notice
boards explained the plans to re-introduce broadleaf trees that
were native to the area. As it was a hot day, we missed the tree
cover - while understanding the purpose behind the sad sight of
thousands of trees on the ground. The heat, though, was certainly
not a bother, and the whole day was one of outstanding beauty -
beautiful blue sky, blue lake, blue bluebells! Stunning!</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">We came to Anchorage Cottage, our
B&amp;B for the night. Since most people want to get to
Rowardennan on that leg, and Anchorage Cottage is four miles
short of Rowardennan, Izzy has a scheme. She had invited us to
stop in and say &quot;hello&quot; as we passed by, but then
suggested that we go on to Rowardennan. She would come pick us up
there when we telephoned her. We did as she had said. She and
Ivor were outside working when we arrived. Her father was
visiting, and was very happy because Celtic had just won some
football championship. They kindly invited us in for a cold
drink, but we decided to keep going, instead. The path continued
on through woods, going up a hill with a rock face where we
watched young children being taught rock climbing techniques.
Alida thought about how much Brigitta would like that. We bumped
into Zoe and Jonathan, who were calling on their cell phone to
find the location of their place for the night. It was supposed
to be a woods cottage, and they thought they had found it, but
wanted to call someone and make sure! </font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Izzy picked us up when we phoned,
and after we took showers and relaxed a bit, Ivor drove us back
down to Balmaha for our dinner. Both car rides had us mildly
terrified - it's a very narrow, very twisty, very hilly road, and
they drove very fast. Well, maybe it wasn't really fast, if you
knew the road as they do. In any case, we appreciated the ride,
and the ride back from dinner. We ate at the same place, the Oak
Tree Inn, where we had had a morning break. And again the English
threesome were at the next table. We asked Ivor on the way back
whether he knew the age of the &quot;old oak&quot; in front of
the inn. He said that it was 600 years old, and there had been
concern when they did road work about whether the roots would be
harmed; apparently they weren't.</font></p>
