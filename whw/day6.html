<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><u>Bridge of Orchy to Kings House
Hotel - Wednesday, May 30</u></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">We started off by crossing the
bridge itself. This was built in 1750, and is one of the best of
the bridges on the military roads. We then climbed a hill to a
good viewpoint, with views forward to Lake Tulla and Rannoch Moor
and back to Bridge of Orchy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">After going down to Loch Tulla we
were on a little road that went past the Inveroran Hotel, to
Forest Lodge. Here there was a gate blocking vehicles at the
entrance to the road (an old drove road) across Rannoch Moor. We
were astounded at the sign saying &quot;Fire Risk Acute&quot;,
when the ground was so soggy. Did it really mean what it said?</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The road across Rannoch Moor didn't
seem as forbidding and desolate as I had pictured it, although
the prospect of making one's way without a road, as Alan Breck
Stewart and David Balfour did, was hard to imagine. The moor was
mostly either bogs or waterways, small or large. The mountains,
with their snow patches, became more and more impressive. The
walking was easy, and soon after lunch we were at the other side,
with the picture-book view of Buachaille Etive Mor behind Black
Rock Cottage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">We were not far from the base of the
ski lift, where there's a museum, so Andy went running up to see
whether it was open. Unfortunately, we were in the gap between
the winter season and the summer season, and it was closed till
the next week. We crossed the highway and walked on to the
Kingshouse Hotel, where we were spending the night. We enjoyed
the atmosphere of the centuries old building. </font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">It had had a bad reputation some
centuries ago, when it catered to drovers and smugglers. Now it's
just an old, rambling building, with floors that aren't level,
and a warren of halls and rooms. We had a comfortable, relaxing
afternoon in the lounge, where we were the only occupants. We
enjoyed both the coal fire in the fireplace and the incredible
views through the big picture windows.</font></p>
