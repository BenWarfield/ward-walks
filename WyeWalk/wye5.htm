<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We left Hereford the next
morning, again crossing the Victoria Bridge. The river must be
quite shallow, or maybe this fisherman whom we watched from the
bridge was on some sort of waterbar:</font></p>

familiar terrain, on a path beside the Wye, with those flowers
between us and the river.</font></p>

        <td><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">An older
        gentleman came the other direction, and my guess was that
        he would know what these flowers were. We asked him, and
        had a wonderful long chat with him. We told him, when he
        asked, that we were doing the Wye Valley Walk. He said
        that he used to walk like that, but he had had a stroke a
        few years ago. Now he walks only (!) six miles every day,
        up the river and back. He said that the flowers are
        impatiens glandulifera, or Himalayan Balsam, and they're
        familiarly known as policeman's helmet. They are in fact
        an obnoxious weed and are quite harmful. Their roots are
        shallow and they cause riverbanks to collapse. Too bad -
        we thought they were pretty! I took a quick picture of
        him after he left.</font></td>

        (1930s) three-wheeler automobile passed us, and then a
        few minutes later we caught up with it. The driver had
        stopped to chat with a couple of friends. Just when we
        got there the car had to move on because another car came
        along the road, but the two fellows were cheerful
        talkers. The taller man gave me some hazlenuts that he
        had just picked. He opened them for me. Thann talked with
        the shorter man, and then we both walked with him along
        the road. He was from Scotland, near Fort William. It was
        long ago that he left Scotland, but he and his wife go
        back every year.</font></td>

        the Scot turned off on a side road we came to a house
        with a monkey puzzle tree. For some reason - maybe its
        name - we've always enjoyed these. We stopped to take its
        picture and a woman came out of the house. She told us a
        lot about the tree. One fact I remember is that she
        planted it too near the road, and she has to trim the
        lower branches frequently. </font><p align="center"><font

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">An hour or so later we
entered the Bulmers orchard. This was a large orchard, but it
still was just a small part of Bulmers, as they make tons of
cider, including Strongbow and Woodpecker. We appreciated their
welcome sign.</font></p>

        Monnington Court. At the far end of this avenue we turned
        off to find our B&amp;B for the night, Dairy House Farm,
        part of the estate. They kindly drove us to a pub for
        dinner, since we didn't fancy walking an extra two or
        three miles.</font></td>
