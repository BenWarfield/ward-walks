<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">This was going to be a
short walk today, so we set breakfast for 8:30 and got some extra
sleep. When we went downstairs the doors to the dining room were
locked. We were puzzling about what to do when Dave appeared. He
said that he always wakes up at 7:00, but this morning he slept
till 8:10. His wife was away for a day, picking up their son who
was in Bath. Dave was clearly having problems managing without
her.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The morning's walking
again included a hill to climb. We ate lunch in a pleasant spot,
leaning against a stone wall, looking at a pretty heather-covered
hillside, and shooing off sheep that were interested in our food.</font></p>

        Gwy, or Waterfall on the Wye) is a historic market town.
        It's small, with a population under 3,000, but it's a
        population center for this rural area. Rhayader is the
        first town on the Wye, counting from the source of the
        Wye. </font><p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We

        the ability of the cars and trucks to maneuver around the
        clock tower and each other, seeming to know what they
        were doing. Rhayader has always been a natural
        crossroads, and now the clock tower is at the
        intersection of two of mid-Wales's busiest roads. A
        bypass has been under discussion for years.</font><p><font
        size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We were there at 4:15, as
        one can see. At the corner by the clock was the inviting
        &quot;Old Swan Tea Shop&quot;, so in we popped for tea
        and scones.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The next
morning started with several miles of road-walking, mostly
climbing a hill, but then came a very enjoyable stretch. We were
in fields, and then we descended on a pleasant path with springy
turf underfoot and great views ahead.</font></p>

Centre with exhibits. A friendly volunteer offered to make us
tea, so we had a fine break. There has been a farm here for many
centuries, and traditional methods of farming have always been
used. There are thus many varieties of plants and wildlife that
have disappeared elsewhere. After our tea we went into the 15th
century longhouse, across the farmyard. </font></p>

we were on a bit later was the Monks' Trod, used by Cistercian
monks, before Henry VIII demolished the monasteries, going
between the monasteries of Strata Florida and Abbey Cwm Hir.
Gerald of Wales, in the 12th century, would have walked this
path.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We were
fascinated by the sight of a herd of sheep charging down a
hillside. I took a picture, but then had to change the camera's
memory card. By the time I got the job done, the sheep were
mostly down, and we saw the reason for their hurry - there was a
vehicle of some sort behind them.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We spent the
night in Llangurig at another &quot;Old Vicarage&quot;, yet
another enjoyable B&amp;B. It was one of those lovely situations
where we're met at the door with a friendly &quot;I'll show you
your room, and when you come down there will be tea and cakes for
you in the lounge.&quot; What a life!</font></p>
