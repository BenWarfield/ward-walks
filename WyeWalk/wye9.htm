<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">This was our
final day of the Wye Valley Walk. The view back to Llangurig when
we crossed over the Wye the following morning was most appealing.

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">After our
almost standard hill-climbing beginning to the day, in an hour or
so we descended again to the Wye. It was dwindling, but still a
river.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">There were
a few last stiles to cross:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">and then we
entered a large farmyard. We were decidedly put off by the sign
beside the farm track as we entered:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">After reading
this, we had second thoughts about our plans to sit and eat lunch
there. We walked for a couple of hours on their farm tracks. The
farm, as well as being a huge sheep farm, is the &quot;Sweet Lamb
Motorsport Complex&quot;. There are frequent car and motorcycle
rallies held here. For the first few miles we were beside the Wye
for the final time. It was now definitely a stream rather than a
river. Here are the last pictures of our friendly Wye River:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="DSC00595s.jpg" width="792" height="492"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The farm
covers miles and miles of the lower slopes of Plynlimon.
Plynlimon is a mountain covering a large area, though it has no
spectacular peaks. In Welsh, it's Pumlumon (the Welsh
&quot;u&quot; sounds like the English short i), and pum means
five. There are five peaks, though they look more like rounded
hilltops. Five rivers have their source on Plynlimon, including
the Severn and the Rheidol, as well as the Wye. I had expected an
afternoon of mountain-climbing, but the whole day was just gentle
walking. We went through sheep pens:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="DSC00597s.jpg" width="648" height="490"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">and passed
the ruins of a silver mine:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="DSC00600s.jpg" width="648" height="486"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">before
finally looking up into the hills toward the source of the Wye:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="DSC00601s.jpg" width="720" height="540"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Our path now
left the Wye and headed off through a forest, the Hafren Forest.
Then in an odd twist, we reached the infant Severn River. When
you read about the Severn Bridges, usually that they're closed
because of high winds, the newspapers are referring to the
mile-long bridges down south for the M4 and M48 motorways. Our
&quot;Severn Bridge&quot; was considerably more peaceful!</font></p>

        walking for a half-mile on the Severn Way, which we could
        have followed another 210 miles. But we didn't. So there
        you have it - the final bit of our Wye Valley Walk was
        beside the Severn!</font><p align="center"><img
