breakfast at the Dairy House Farm</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">and then set off. A couple
of hours later we were crossing the Wye again, this time in
Bredwardine. We were still in England, by the way. The bridge,
built in 1769, has those typical cutwaters, part of the bridge
construction but handy for pedestrians who need to duck out of
the way of cars.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">For the next several hours
we were climbing a hill, Merbach Hill. There were many fields,
and many good views.</font></p>

reading his map, trying to figure which direction to take to get
out of the field:</font></p>

the trig point on top of Merbach Hill:</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We had booked two nights,
to have a rest day there. We walked up to the Castle Bookshop,
with its outside bookshelves:</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We just relaxed the next
day, doing not much except for visiting six or eight (or ten?)
bookshops and the outdoor shop. We managed to buy only five or
six small books. And we did a load of clothes at the laundromat.
And we had warm-from-the-oven scones at an excellent tea shop.
Here's Thann getting cash from Barclay's, and the sign for the
Granary Cafe where we had dinner, with the town clock beyond:</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We admired the restoration
work that our host, John Thomas, is doing on the building behind
their house. They hope to retire from the B&amp;B business in a
few years and live in the house John is restoring.</font></p>
