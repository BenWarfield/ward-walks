<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">At the start of the walk
is a map, of a sort that we saw a good many times over the next
two weeks. The map shows several miles of the path (red and
yellow) and landmarks in the area. You can see the &quot;You are
here&quot; in Chepstow, and the path for the first six or seven
miles of the day, up past Tintern. The spots marked as viewpoints
(with rays) were well above the river - the map doesn't show
elevation changes!</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The walk begins on a path
up the hill behind Chepstow Castle. The castle is the oldest
surviving stone castle in Britain, built soon after the conquest
in 1066.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">For several miles the walk
is through the Piercefield Estate, well above the Wye. The walks
in the estate were designed in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, when
tourism came to this area.There are follies and viewpoints along
the way:</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It started raining before
we reached Tintern. In fact, the last half mile down (really
down) to Tintern was on a very slippery rocky path that had once
been a drovers' route. Pity the poor cattle! We did no more than
glance at Tintern Abbey as we passed, remembering many pleasant
visits there. We knew that there was a cafe in the Tintern Old
Station set of restored old railway cars, and we hoped to warm up
and dry off while drinking a pot of tea. Unfortunately many
people had that idea and the tables were full. We kept walking
and the rain stopped not too much later. We ate our sandwiches
and apples while happily sitting on a bench and drying off.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Then it was back uphill
again, up above the river. For reward there were beautiful views
down:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It was hours
later when we once again descended to the river level. We then
walked beside the Wye for several miles.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It was almost
7pm when we finally got to Redbrook, after a long day. There we
crossed the river on a pedestrian bridge which was formerly a
railway bridge. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We were very
happy when we looked at the village and spotted the Blue Bell
Inn, our place for the night. It's the white building at the
right:</font></p>

        looked back under it, and found with glee the
        &quot;Wolfman Jack&quot; inscription on a girder. We had
        enjoyed it many years ago when we went through Redbrook
        on the Offa's Dyke Path.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We
