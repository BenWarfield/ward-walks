<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We arrived in Monmouth and
stopped in a pub on Agincourt Square. &quot;Agincourt&quot;
honors Henry V, who was born in Monmouth. From the window of the
pub we could see the two statues, Henry V up on the wall and
Charles Rolls with his biplane. Afterwards I took a better
picture of them. Rolls, of Rolls-Royce, had a home nearby, and
was a biplane enthusiast. In fact, he was the first Briton to die
in a </font><a href="http://earlyaviators.com/erolls.htm"><font

Monmouth, we made our way back to the river. It poured rain for a
short while as we were leaving town, but then the sun came out
brilliantly. </font></p>

        and continues to the present, but then we read that the
        church is in fact considerably older than that implies.
        One of the walls has herring-bone masonry, a style used
        by the Saxons, so the church must have existed in
        pre-Norman times.</font></td>

were walking through a long wooded section by the river, a sign

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">An hour later we were at
Biblins Bridge, a 200-foot-long suspension bridge across the Wye.
It's near a campground and its bounciness is enjoyed by many
young campers. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">After a short time we
arrived in Symonds Yat. We deposited our packs in our guest house
and went to a pub, the Saracen's Head. We had an iPod with us on
the walk, so we could connect to the internet and check our email
whenever we were in a Wi-Fi hotspot. I had looked before the trip
for a list of such spots, and the Saracen's Head was on the list.</font></p>

        checked that the pub served dinner until 9:00, and since
        it was only 6:00 we figured we had time for a walk around
        the end of the peninsula that the Wye forms and then back
        up and over the hill in the middle of the little
        peninsula. Up on top this hill is &quot;Yat Rock&quot; a
        (relatively) famous viewpoint. Our choice of route turned
        out to be not great. Clearly no one had walked that way
        in a long time, as we had to make our way through
        head-high growth on marshy paths. After several miles we
        found a little unmarked path up the side of the hill, and
        that fortunately turned out to be the path we wanted. We
        got up to Yat Rock and admired the views in all
        directions.</font></td>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A dark cloud had us
hurrying onward, back down to Symonds Yat and the Saracen's Head
pub. Unfortunately there were several paths going down, all
unmarked. After a couple of tries on paths that seemed to turn
the wrong direction (Thann's intuition was pretty good), we
settled on one and zoomed down it. We really hoped it was right,
because twilight had come and gone, and we really wanted to get
to the pub in time to eat! Well, it worked - and we very much
enjoyed our dinners!</font></p>
