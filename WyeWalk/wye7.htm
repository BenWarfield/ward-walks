<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">For a while
we were on a sunken path by the river, with the fields well above
us. The map showed a standing stone in one of the fields, so we
scrambled up the bank and were totally amazed that we had
happened to come up at exactly the correct spot! (We don't know
anything about the history or the age of this standing stone.)</font></p>

        Bridge was a narrow wooden bridge, surprisingly still
        used by cars. From far away we could hear occasional cars
        on the bridge. Thann went out to look at the river:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It was a
shock when a car came roaring onto the far end of the bridge.
There definitely wasn't room for a pedestrian beside a car, so
Thann ran fast - very fast! - and just made it off the bridge as
the car, which hadn't slowed down at all, zoomed past. Whew!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We spent the
night in a B&amp;B called &quot;The Old Vicarage&quot;, one of
several such on our walk. Maybe vicars are no longer provided
with a vicarage? As we left the next morning we loooked for a
postbox, and were delighted with the one we found:</font></p>

a rather grey day. We were soon climbing another hill, with
occasional views down to the valley:</font></p>

springy turf through the heather:</font></p>

down from the hills, the views north of the Wye Valley were again

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The town that
we were coming into was Builth Wells. It's pronounced
&quot;Bilth&quot;, and that's anglicized from the Welsh. Bu
(cow), gellt (pasture). In the 19th century, &quot;Wells&quot;
was added because of the medicinal waters. You'll be happy to
hear that we found ice cream at a shop in the town (where we also
bought bread and cheese for the next few lunches).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A couple of
hours later we were tired and saw a bench. We were disappointed
to see it labeled &quot;Private&quot;. We kept walking. After two
or three more private benches we said &quot;Phooey to you,
whoever you are&quot; and sat down for a snack!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Builth had
been about half-way for the day, nine miles before and seven
after, but these last seven miles were easy, so that just a few
hours later we came to our destination for the night, the New Inn
in Newbridge. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Of course
neither the town nor the inn is actually &quot;new&quot;. In the
sixteenth century, this inn replaced an earlier one - hence the
&quot;New Inn&quot;. We enjoyed talking with the owner, Dave,
while waiting for our dinners. </font></p>
