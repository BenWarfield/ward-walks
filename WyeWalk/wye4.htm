<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Our walk to Hereford the
next day was short, planned that way to give us the afternoon to
see the city. An hour after leaving Fownhope we were going
through the village of Mordiford. We liked the view back, after
we had crossed the bridge over the Lugg.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We read various Edward
Elgar references for the next few days, because he lived just up
the road from here. His Elegy for Strings, Opus 58, is said to
have been inspired by the view from this bridge. We walked for
almost a mile along the flood banks of the Lugg and came to the
village of Hampton Bishop. We took a short detour to visit its
church, and we were very glad we did. It's an interesting church,
mostly 12th century, built of local sandstone, with an unusual
medieval topping on its Norman tower. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">There was a table inside
with used books for sale. We happily reduced our backpack weights
by a pound by donating the books we had brought to read on the
plane!</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Not much later we were
crossing a wheat field to return to our riverside walking.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We had been walking
upstream beside the Wye, and it had been navigable for only the
first few days of our walk. We were thus startled to see a barge.
Hmmmm......</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="DSC00237s.jpg" width="792"

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">There was a
surprisingly long walk on city streets through the outskirts of
Hereford, but we finally arrived at our B&amp;B. We were too
early and the owner was busy cleaning our room, but she kindly
made tea for us and we relaxed comfortably with tea and cookies
in her lounge. We then set off to explore Hereford. We quickly
spotted an ice cream van, much to Thann's delight.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Our first
objective was to find a place to get some prints of pictures that
I had taken. We had been forced to buy a new camera on the first
day of the walk when my camera stopped functioning, and we wanted
to be sure that the new camera was in fact working. The Boots in
Hereford had the processing capabilities we needed, and the
pictures looked all right, so we proceeded on to the sightseeing.
We ate our sandwiches in a park, wandered around, and finally
visited the cathedral.</font></p>

We enjoyed our afternoon in Hereford!</font></p>
