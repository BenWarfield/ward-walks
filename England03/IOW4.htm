<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our B&amp;B host warned us that the
coastal path had been diverted for the first few miles east of
Freshwater, because of road work on the road just inland from the
path. We found our way back to the coast (we had detoured a
couple of miles from the path to get to Freshwater), arriving at
the roadworks, with the coastline showing why the road had to be
moved.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We got back down to
the coastal edge, and the views back toward Freshwater and
Tennyson Down were great.</font></p>

we crossed a car park, where recent damage hasn't yet been
repaired:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">As the cliffs in this
area fall down, many dinosaur fossils have emerged. One guidebook
even assured us that we were likely to see casts of dinosaur
footprints, in chunks of stone that had fallen from the eroding
cliff. We looked. Maybe we didn't know what to look for, but
sadly nothing seemed to us to be a dinosaur footprint. All the
same, we picked up some rocks that we decided to claim as
dinosaur bones!</font></p>

        Chine is particularly steep-sided. The wooden steps down
