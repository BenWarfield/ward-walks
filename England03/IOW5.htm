<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Chale to Shanklin</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Almost immediately after leaving
Chale we were at Blackgang Chine. There's a theme park at the top
of the chine, including shops and amusement rides. We stopped in
&quot;The Fossil Shop&quot;, a small shop full of fossils on
exhibit and for sale. They also lead groups on fossil-hunting
expeditions; when we arrived the shop was swarming with school
children. One of the proprietors was telling them what to look
for, and showing them examples, preparing them for their outing.
The lecture made it clear - if it hadn't been before - that the
&quot;dinosaur bones&quot; which we had picked up on the beach
are nothing special. But we kept them, and carried them with us,
and still think of them as our dinosaur bones!</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Soon we were climbing the hill
behind and above St. Catherine's lighthouse, finally looking down
on it.</font></p>

        Smuggling History.&quot; We spent a long time there,
        seeing lots of amazing smuggling methods. This wax model
        is of Margaret, the wife of Thomas Cranmer. He was
        archbishop-elect of Canterbury, and supposedly celibate,
        when he smuggled her into the country in a herring
        barrel!</font></td>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">After a few more downs and ups we
came to Ventnor, a Victorian resort town. We stopped immediately
at the first pub for drinks, enjoying them while sitting outside
in the bright sun. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We had spent a lot of time stopping
and seeing things during the day, and the last four miles into
Shanklin seemed long. We finally arrived, checked in at our guest
house, and went to the town park, where we had read that there
was a brass band concert. We listened for a while, and then went
to dinner at a restaurant in the &quot;Old Town&quot; area, which
is mostly thatched cottages.</font></p>
