<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Cowes to Yarmouth</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We had a leisurely start from
Cowes, spending most of an hour waiting for, and then watching, a
yacht race. Cowes is the &quot;yachting capital&quot; of Britain.
When we walked down to the promenade by the water we saw the sign
on the side of the wall (part of the Royal Yacht Squadron
headquarters), and the uniformed race starter:</font></p>

        <td><img src="RaceStarter.jpg" width="336" height="252"></td>
    </tr>
</table>
</center></div>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We overheard enough to learn that
the starting cannon would be fired in about twenty minutes, so we
decided to wait and watch. Not liking loud noises, I wandered on
down the promenade, past the cannons which were from Henry VIII's
castle here.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The first few miles for the day
were along the Cowes promenade and its extension, past Egypt
Point (the northernmost tip of the Isle of Wight), and past lots
of people out appreciating the sunny weekend. Beach huts lined
the walkway near Gurnard.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We finally were on an actual
footpath, and almost immediately were in the sort of situation
that we encountered for the whole Coastal Path. Erosion had eaten
away large chunks of the cliff. Farmers had put up barbed wire
fences to keep livestock from falling into the sea, and the coast
path was squeezed between fence and edge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We ate lunch after dropping down to
a bit of sandy beach, and then spent several hours on the inland
route necessitated by the large estuary of the Newtown River.
Newtown itself was an important port in the 13th century. It was
burned by the French in 1377 and never recovered. As a tiny
village, it was one of the &quot;rotten boroughs&quot;, with two
members of Parliament until the reforms of 1832. We liked this
corner cottage with a postbox built in:</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We survived a stretch of walking
beside a fast, busy road, and then had pleasant lanes and paths
to Shalfleet. We were very hot and thirsty, having been rationing
out our water supply, so were disappointed to find the inn closed
for the mid-afternoon hours. We saw that there was a village
shop, but sadly found it closed on Sunday. We sat and rested near
some houses. When a woman drove up her driveway, I went over and
asked whether she'd mind refilling our water flasks. She didn't
mind, so we left Shalfleet happily, with our thirst quenched and
our bottles full.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our route led us in a big loop,
back again near the estuary, which we saw across marshy meadows.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The route through
Bouldnor Forest has been repeatedly moved back from the cliff, as
the cliff falls into the sea. Down below us were many fallen
trees at the water's edge. We arrived at Yarmouth just before the
rain, which had been threatening, began pouring. Lucky timing!</font></p>
