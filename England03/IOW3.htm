        face="Comic Sans MS">This was a day with many
        &quot;sights&quot; to see. Before leaving Yarmouth, we
        stopped in the church to see the curious marble statue we
        had read about. A French ship was captured by the
        governor of the island in the mid-1600s, Sir Robert
        Holmes, and on the ship was an unfinished statue of King
        Louis IV. It lacked the head, and as the sculptor was
        captured, too, Holmes demanded that he substitute
        Holmes's head for the King's!</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The path through Fort Victoria
Country Park was in a mature woodland, with views across to Hurst
&quot;Castle&quot; on the mainland, just a mile away. This was
begun in Henry VIII's time because of concerns about the French,
and added to by the Victorians.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We wound our way down
to the water's edge again, and again were on a seafront
promenade. But then we climbed back up and suddenly were in a
quite different environment, a heather downland. Headon Warren
isn't a large area, but it seems to be in another world. Besides
the heather and gorse, there was another flower that we found
striking. We tried unsuccessfully to find it in our flower book.</font></p>

        a while we ran into a local couple walking their dog, and
        asked what the flower was. They said &quot;Oh, it's just
        a weed.&quot; They told us it's rosebay willowherb. Weed
        or not, we still think it's pretty!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The soil here
        seemed to be halfway between chalk and seashells, a
        curious terrain.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We soon were excited
by seeing the Needles, the famous chalk stacks at the west end of
the Isle of Wight. We could even see the lighthouse at the far
end.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="HeadonWarren3.jpg" width="480" height="360"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">With the Needles still
in view, we walked the ridge to the end of the hill, to the ruins
of yet another fort. The photo shows the top of the chair lift
that one can use to go down to the bay. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="HeadonWarren4.jpg" width="577" height="288"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">And the reason that
one wants to go down to the bay is that it's Alum Bay, with the
celebrated multi-colored sands. We did in fact take the chair
lift and ate our sandwiches while sitting on the beach, admiring
the colors of the sand cliffs.</font></p>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td><font face="Comic Sans MS">After we came back up by
        the lift, we continued on toward the Needles, frequently
        stopping to look back toward Alum Bay. </font></td>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the photo below,
Headon Warren with its heather stretches across the top. The
chair lift (at the left) descends from a theme park where we
bought figures filled with sands of various colors from the bay. </font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="AlumBay2.jpg" width="720"
height="314"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We walked out to the
&quot;Old Battery&quot; at the end of the point nearest the
Needles. The fort there wasn't used for long, because it turned
out that the chalk cliffs crumbled whenever they fired a cannon!
Hence the &quot;New Battery&quot;, up the hill. But in the Old
Battery there's a passageway underground for 200 feet out to a
searchlight emplcement. At that point, you're at the westernmost
tip of the island, just overlooking the chalk stacks of the
Needles.</font></p>

</center></div>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">After appreciating the
views at the Needles, we climbed back up the hill, and followed a
pleasant path over the chalk downland for a mile or so, down and
then back up again to Tennyson Down. Tennyson lived near here,
and his popularity attracted many eminent scholars to the island.
There's a monument to him at the crest of the down.</font></p>

    </tr>

</center></div>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">From Tennyson Down, we
walked down to Freshwater Bay, while enjoying the views over the
chalk cliffs and sea. From our B&amp;B in Freshwater, it would
have been only a few miles to where we started the day, in
Yarmouth! We had walked southwest, out to the Needles, and then
southeast, bringing us back just south of Yarmouth. Very
inefficient, but a great day!</font></p>
