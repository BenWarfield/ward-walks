<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ryde to Cowes</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">We landed at Heathrow on a Saturday
morning and sleepily took a bus, then train, to Portsmouth. We
crossed the Solent on a catamaran, landing in Ryde. After walking
down the half-mile long pier, we walked around Ryde, ate lunch,
bought the Isle of Wight Explorer map at the tourist office, and
stopped by the B&amp;B where we would stay at the end of the
circuit. We had asked permission to leave two small bags with
clothes we wouldn't need.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">By mid-afternoon we
were on our way, soon passing the ruins of Quarr Abbey. Limestone
from the area was quarried to build this abbey, as well as
Winchester and Chichester Cathedrals; hence the name of the
abbey. It was founded in 1132, and contributed much to the
island's education and poor relief; now, thanks to Henry VIII,
it's just ruined walls on a farm.</font></p>

cottage is attached to an abbey building, and we were once again
admiring the typical English front garden. </font></p>

        House, seeing its towers. It was the favorite residence
        of Queen Victoria, and she spent much time here. That was
        a major reason for the popularity of the Isle of Wight
        during the nineteenth century.</font><p><font
