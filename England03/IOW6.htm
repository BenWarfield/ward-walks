<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Not sure why, but I took almost no
pictures. I have one of a warning sign. On the less frequented
paths, earlier, we hadn't seen such warnings, though the message
would certainly have been à propos.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The only other photo is of a large
sea-wall project near Ryde. We stood for a long time, watching
the giant drill making a hole 30 feet deep. It then poured in
concrete as it reversed and came back up. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The day was pleasant enough, but we
were fairly frequently in towns. This 15-mile stretch along the
north-east coast is mostly through populated areas. The final
approach to Ryde was along the waterfront, and we watched the
many, frequent ferries and hovercraft crossing the Solent to and
from Portsmouth and Southampton, enjoying our final ice cream
cones of the walk.</font></p>
