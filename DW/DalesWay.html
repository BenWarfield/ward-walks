<h1 align="center">Dales Way, Ilkley to Bowness</h1>

<p>We started our Dales Way walk in a typical manner, wandering
around and enjoying Ilkley for several hours before actually
setting out. We stopped in the Tourist Office, where the cheerful
ladies on duty sang &quot;On Ilkley Moor Baht'at&quot; for us.
That was a song that we had sung at Bryn Mawr, so I had been
hoping to hear it sung properly. We also spent time at the parish
church, appreciating the 8th and 9th century carved stones, as
well as the Norman door. A kind volunteer showed us around.</p>

<p>The day had many highlights. We were almost immediately in
pleasant farmland, among cows and sheep. In Lob Wood we had our
first encounter with a carpet of bluebells, and were overwhelmed.
Almost all day we were beside the Wharfe, which was generally
wide and calm. </p>

<p>We wandered around Bolton Priory, but couldn't cross on the
stepping stones, which were under water. We crossed instead on a
bridge, the first of many crossings of the Wharfe.</p>

<p>We had sandwiches at the Cavendish Pavilion (after crossing
back again to the right bank), and then walked through Strid
Wood, a nature preserve. We weren't tempted in the slightest to
jump across the river at &quot;the Strid&quot;, a pair of
boulders which the the river is forced between. The river is very
swift and the people who try to jump and don't succeed are no
longer with us! The woods, however, are quite pleasant. We didn't
manage to spot any of the birds which were pictured on the
information panel, but that's not unusual for us!</p>

<p>We crossed back on a &quot;castellated&quot; footbridge,
apparently made that way for the appreciation of residents of
Barden Tower, which was in sight farther upstream. More pleasant
walking brought us to Burnsall. Its parish church dates from the
14th century. Next door to the church is a grammar school, built
in the Elizabethan era.</p>

<p>After Burnsall we were on the right bank again, up above the
now faster river as it passed Loup Scar. Soon we came to the
bouncy suspension bridge, so narrow that Penny's wide pack barely
made it! The stretch of path through the meadows from here to
Grassington seemed especially pleasant to us. There were big
horse chestnut trees and sheep and a calm river -- it was all so
beautiful!</p>

<p>We loved Grassington. We went to lots of shops, as well as the
National Park Visitor Center. The town was full of people, and it
all seemed very cheerful. The route from Grassington to
Kettlewell is away from the river, for a change. It goes through
some wonderful &quot;limestone pavement&quot; sections, and
passes a large lime kiln.</p>

<p>We passed Conistone Pie, a natural limestone formation that
looks from far off like a tower. From the top there were distant
views of valleys and hills and villages, as well as closer views
of the river and the drystone walls and Kilnsey Crag with its
inevitable rock climbers. Then a few miles further the path sent
us back down, through a woods. We stopped to chat with a fellow
repairing a dry stone wall, and he told how incredibly slow and
difficult the job is. We were soon walking down the green lane
into Kettlewell.</p>

<p>Since we were all three freezing (it was cold and very windy),
we stopped for hot soup in a little tea shop. The fire in the
fireplace was most welcome. Then the next stretch, to Buckden,
was again wonderful. We heard the birds singing and the sheep and
lambs bleating, and the path meandered between the fields and the
river. On, then, to Hubberholme. We stood on the bridge for a
long time, looking at the birds. All guide books seem to be
constantly talking about dippers, and we hadn't seen any. A
fellow standing on the bridge said that there had been one there,
and said (of course) &quot;You can't miss it.&quot; Well, we
missed it, even after trying hard! </p>

<p>Not much farther along, after a few more fields and meadows,
we came to Yockenthwaite. It seems to consist of a farm, a
bridge, and a prehistoric stone circle. The stone circle is quite
complete, about 30 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>By now the Wharfe had shrunk considerably, and the valley was
now called Langstrothdale rather than Wharfedale. The path, after
crossing the river yet again, goes on a track beside the river,
up to the little hamlet of Beckermonds. Here we turned up a
little road through Oughtershaw before crossing fields to Cam
Houses. Just before leaving the river (now called Oughtershaw
Beck) for the last time, we stopped for a picnic on warm, flat
big rocks in the middle. It was so pleasant and comfortable, we
even stretched out for naps! After we roused ourselves we walked
on, through the farms of Swarthgill and Nethergill. The farmer at
Nethergill, a retired headmaster, was extremely friendly and
talkative, and we learned a lot about his Jacob sheep. They're
odd looking, with spots. His story was that they're descendants
of the Biblical Jacob's sheep, their ancestors having crossed
from Northern Africa to Spain, sailed with the Spanish Armada,
and come ashore when the Armada wrecked in Northern England. He
said &quot;They came straight to Nethergill!&quot; </p>

<p>The last mile or so to Cam Houses was across mushy, somewhat
difficult terrain, as the ground was quite wet. The surroundings
had become rather bleak, just in the last few miles. We were
enormously cheered by Dorothy Smith, at Cam Houses. The door was
open, and when I called in saying &quot;Hello, Mrs. Smith!&quot;,
she called back &quot;Hello! The kettle's just coming to the
boil; would you like some tea?&quot; It was a great welcome,
which preceded an equally great evening. Her dinner was
excellent, and the after-dinner time in the lounge, with a
roaring fire, as we sank back into the comfortable soft chairs,
made me feel I was in a dream. It was exactly as if we were in a
James Herriot scene, listening to the soft, broad, almost
incomprehensible (to us) Yorkshire accents of Dorothy and her
partner, Robin. The final treat came after I mentioned that I had
always wanted to see sheep dogs go through their paces. Robin
quietly went out and called his dogs together, and Dorothy led us
out after him to witness our own private sheep dog trial!
Ingleborough provided a rosy background in the setting sun, and
the dogs chased the sheep around us and off over the darkening
hills. Pure magic! </p>

<p>After Cam Houses, we were on a bit of the Cam High Road, a
Roman road, before dropping down to Ribblehead. We had decided to
take a variant, going past the Ribblehead Viaduct and over the
flanks of Whernside. Unfortunately, while we were on the Cam High
Road it started raining. By the time we reached the Station Inn
near the viaduct, we were drenched. We stopped in for something
to eat and drink, hoping the rain would end. After a long time,
while we watched some men playing game after game of pool and
listened to the rain, we gave up, put our rain clothes back on,
and set out. It never cleared up, so it was a fairly dreary day.
The next day, though, was fine again, and we thoroughly enjoyed
Dent, with its cobbled, narrow streets.</p>

        since then been rerouted across fields), and we were
        considerably slowed by having bought a flower book in
        Dent. We had to look up every flower we saw, and there
        were many interesting varieties lining the lane. After
        the lane crossed the river, our path climbed a hill and
        we left Dentdale. Our stay in Dentdale hadn't been long,
        but it was beautiful!</td>

<p>We came down the other side of the hill into Millthrop, and
began walking beside the River Rawthey. There was a short stretch
along a busy road (the A683), and we missed the turn off of it.
As we stood in a lay-by to check the map, we looked behind us and
were astounded by the sight of a sheep with two extremely new
lambs. The lambs must have been just a few minutes old. The
farmer, who was cutting hay not far away, came over to check on
them. We watched while the lambs struggled to their feet for the
first time and wobbled around. It was a totally new experience
for us! Then, while we were still engrossed in the lamb
spectacle, we began to see horse-drawn gypsy caravans coming
along the road. We asked someone that evening, and learned that
they were on their way to the Appleby Horse Fair. So that was
second unusual sight, again because of missing our turn!</p>

filled with bluebells, and then the Crook of Lune Bridge, both of
which seemed outstandingly beautiful to us.</p>

<p>From Crook of Lune Bridge we could see (with great
anticipation!) the Lake District fells in the distance. There was
more walking before we were actually there, however. The route
went through many farms, and from the tops of hills we had some
wonderful views of the now recognizable mountains ahead of us. We
walked beside several more rivers -- the Mint and the Kent among
them. Near Bowston we saw a different sort of &quot;garden&quot;,
consisting of many dozens of figurines. While we were admiring
it, the owner came out to chat. He said he wasn't any good at
growing things, so this was his solution!</p>
