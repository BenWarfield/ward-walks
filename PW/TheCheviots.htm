        <td rowspan="2"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">After
        Greenhead came the Hadrian's Wall day. As our book
        suggested, we had planned a short day, just eight miles,
        in order to have time to appreciate the Wall. We spent a
        couple of hours in the Roman Army Museum at Carvoran,
        partly because we liked it, but also because it was
        pouring rain outside and we had an early lunch in their
        little cafe. Hadrian's Wall, at least on these ten miles
        on this day and the next, goes constantly steeply uphill
        and down. It follows the crest of the craggy Whin Sill, a
        ridge of dolorite that extends across England. The wall
        was originally about 16 feet high, and now varies from
        about six feet down to nothing. Sometimes it's buried,
        and sometimes the stones have been taken. After the
        Romans left, in the fourth century, local people used the
        stones for their buildings. Our hosts that evening said
        that their house definitely had stones from the Wall in
        its walls. </font></td>

        every Roman mile (1620 yards) they had built a Milecastle.
        These held about fifty men as patrols for sentry duty.

        Milecastle 39. </font><p><font color="#000080"
        face="Arial">The loughs, or lakes, in this area are in
        depressions created during the ice age by slowly moving
        ice sheets. They are all shallow, and are slowly filling
        in with reeds. They will all become bogs in the fairly
        near future. Though there were four loughs visible from
        here, it's Crag Lough in both these photos, first as we
        were walking toward it, and then as we looked back at it.
        The path had gone across the top of Highshields Crags
        above the lough, then down through a pretty woods, before
        the climb (in this photo) up to Hotbank Crags. The Whin
        Sill crags over which we had come yesterday can be seen
        extending toward the west.</font></p>

after a couple of miles. The Border Forests are the largest
commercial plantations (logging forests) in Britain. The Pennine
Way goes through three segments of Wark Forest, and a day later
through Kielder Forest. The route was easy to follow, and the
dark spruces were a diversion from the usual treeless landscape.

Bellingham for the night.</font></p>

        celebration in villages and farms, mostly lots of flags.There
        had been a fair that day in Bellingham, and our hosts for
        the evening had just arrived home from it. They greeted
        us wearing their &quot;king and queen&quot; crowns, made
        for them by their grandchildren. They went out to a dance
        for the evening, giving us their house key to get in
        after our dinner at the pub.That was the evening of
        incredible fireworks at Buckingham Palace, and we watched
        on their TV as the Queen lit a fuse to start them off.
        She seemed to like them, too! Then there was the fly-by,
        low over the Mall, of the Concorde and six fighter jets

        going, hopping from one somewhat solid tuft of grass to
        another. That was followed by several miles of gravel
        road through Redesdale Forest before coming to the farm
        of Blakehopeburnhaugh. (Hope=sheltered valley, burn=hill
        stream, haugh=flat land beside a river.) Here we joined a
        little river, the Rede, for the last few miles into
        Byness. Byrness is a small community, most of its houses

        Byrness, we started on the final segment of the Pennine
        Way. We divided this 27 mile section in two, but since
        there's no place to stay on the route, many people do it
        in one day. We climbed steeply up through trees on
        Byrness Hill, to arrive at the open views on the top. It
        was now a walk up and down hills, with wide majestic
        views of the Cheviot hills stretching out in the distance.
        The weather forecast had been dire -- heavy rain and
        winds -- but for the morning it held off and we
        appreciated every minute of thhe scenic walking.</font><p><font

        first meeting with the border fence. This is the border
        between England and Scotland, and we were to follow it,
        or near it, for much of this day and the next. When we
        first encountered it we crossed it into Scotland for a
        short time, returning a mile later into England at Chew
        Green Roman Camp. At this point the camp is all grass
        covered, and one has to imagine the buildings.</font></p>

        hut. There's one on each of the last two days, for use in
        bad weather. We joined Judy and Rob, and Pauline and
        Peter, on the benches around the side walls. By the time
        we started out again it was raining, and it continued for
        the rest of the day. We stopped for a photo in the cloud,
        at Russell's Cairn on Windy Gyle (with Judy, taken by Rob).</font></td>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Not much later we had
arrived at the Border Gate, the point where an ancient track
crossed the ridge. Here we left the Pennine Way and turned
southeast for the mile and a half drop down to Uswayford Farm.
This is the only possible overnight stay near the Pennine Way on
that last 27-mile section. This was the first booking that we had
made; if they hadn't had room, we'd have chosen a time when they
did and rearranged our schedule! When we arrived at the farm, I
was just about to knock on the door when a man drove up on his
tractor. The moment that I started my question, &quot;Is this
Uswayford Farm?&quot; it flashed into my head what his answer
would be. Someone on a web page had written that he had asked
exactly that question, and had been told &quot;No, it's two miles
away, across that next mountain!&quot; So I was prepared, and not
devastated as I would have been otherwise, when he gave that very
same answer! </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The six of us who had had
lunch together were all staying at the farm, in her three guest
bedrooms, and we all very much enjoyed being there. Nancy Buglass
made us a good dinner and we all sat and talked for a long time.
The pictures show Uswayford, with the house and barn joined
together for the severe winters, and Thann putting on his boots
the next morning, in glorious sunshine that lasted for a while,
at least -</font></p>

mile and a half to the border fence, we rejoined the path beside
it. Clouds were swirling around, but the weather was good for
most of the day.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The flagstones
were again welcome, as this stretch used to be notoriously boggy.
In the areas where they had not yet been laid, we had to make our
way around the wet parts, making us all the more appreciative.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">This is a view
looking back toward Hen Hole, a &quot;hanging valley&quot;, with
a waterfall deep in its recesses. We had come down from Auchope
Cairn, the hill on the right:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The next hill
was called the Schil. Views from the top were unfortunately non-existent,
because we were again in a cloud. It was a bit eerie, because jet
planes from some military base were zooming by overhead with
deafening noise but invisible. After the Schil we were on the
final stretch. We crossed the border fence into Scotland, with
just four miles left. Our friends Judy and Rob, who had taken a
slightly different route after the border fence crossing, waited
for us where the paths met, to walk the final mile together. And
then there it was, the Border Hotel!</font></p>
