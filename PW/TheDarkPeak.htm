Dark Peak ---- Edale to Standedge ---- 26 miles ---- 2 days</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Big Moment arrived! We
had a cheerful, encouraging send-off from our B&amp;B, the Old
Parsonage, and then stopped to photograph ourselves in front of
the Old Nags Head.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">It was a warm
and sunny day, and we cheerfully set out across the fields below
the edges of Kinder Scout. We soon came to the National Trust
farm and chatted with the woodworker (whom we had talked with
several years ago). Shortly after that we came to the packhorse
bridge at the bottom of Jacob's Ladder.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">By the time we reached
Edale Rocks, the wind was blowing hard, and it continued most of
the day. There were good views from the edge over to South Head
and then down to Kinder Reservoir. We met an older couple on a
day walk who were encouraging; they had walked most of the
Pennine Way and particularly liked the Cheviots. On Featherbed
Moss we had our first encounter with a long stretch of flag path.
The flags have been laid to stop erosion, there and many other
places along the Pennine Way. Thousands of tons of stone flags
have been brought in by helicopter. The stones come from the
floors of demolished cotton mills, and have a rough surface with
interesting colors. They often have a small remnant of mill
machinery, like a bolt, or a place gouged where equipment had
been.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The flagstones
can be tiring and some walkers are bothered by them. But there's
good precedent for them, with the many stone causeways built for
packhorse routes in the 17th and 18th centuries.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">After crossing
the A57, we started the Bleaklow section. The weather was still
good, so there were no fears. At one point we wandered for a bit,
unsure of the route. </font></p>

</center></div>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">And in the peat groughs,
too deep to see over, there was sometimes uncertainty about which
way to go.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="BleaklowPeat_T.jpg" width="561"
height="360"></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">But we got to
the top easily enough. We then took a north-north-west bearing,
as our book directed, to find the path we wanted. We started
down, and after a few minutes we were beside Wildboar Grain.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="WildboarGrain.jpg" width="499"
height="324"></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">After we
dropped down to cross it, at a ford, we met two young men who had
come down on the &quot;wrong&quot; side, having spent hours (they
said) hunting around on the top of Bleaklow for the path. We
walked together for a bit, and then they went on ahead. As we
walked on the path above Torside Clough, the wind became fierce,
stronger than we've ever been walking in. Fortunately, it was
blowing up from the valley on our right, so that we felt safe.
But many times it blew both of us into the bank on our left. Here
Thann is trying to keep upright in a gust, holding a boulder.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="TorsideCloughWind.jpg" width="609"
height="326"></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">When we reached Torside
Reservoir (in the photo), we found the two young men. I think
they had been worried about us, and they kindly waited to be sure
we survived the wind. We spent the night at a B&amp;B beside
Rhodeswood Reservoir, the next one to the west, happy that the
first day had been such a good one.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">From our breakfast table
the next morning we had a view over the reservoir. We could see
the low cloud covering the hills in the direction we were about
to go. Our host, though, said encouragingly that the mist would
probably start rising soon, and we set off. We rejoined the PW,
crossing the dam between the two reservoirs, and soon were
walking north, with Crowden Great Brook down to our right. After
about a mile, we saw Oakenclough Brook with its waterfall, and a
few minutes later we forded the brook just above the falls.</font></p>

</center></div>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">That brought us to Laddow
Rocks. Our guidebook says &quot;The Way continues along the top
of the crags, close to the edge.&quot; It was indeed close to the
edge, and we watched our feet carefully. Tripping would have had
bad consequences. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><img
src="LaddowRocks.jpg" width="397" height="265"></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">After roughly a mile we met
up again with Crowden Great Brook. We went upstream with it, many
times fording it and its tributaries, heading for Black Hill. A
fellow caught up with us and we walked together for a while. He
was doing a practice outing, intending to do the whole Pennine
Way, starting a week later. We were much buoyed by his statement
that he had heard that Black Hill had flagstones all the way to
the top. The boggy morass on Black Hill is notorious, and we had
dreaded the crossing. His news turned out to be correct, and with
great relief we found ourselves beside the O.S. column at the
top.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><img
src="BlackHillOSColumn.jpg" width="426" height="247"></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">By then we were in a cloud,
and a light rain had started. Again we set off following a
compass bearing, as the flags had stopped shortly after the top.
A few minutes later we saw the first of a set of cairns, and we
knew we were going the right direction. We began dropping down,
now on a good path, and not much later we were out of the cloud,
once again enjoying the views. In addition to the good views, we
could see, a mile ahead, a small white spot. We had read about
&quot;Snoopy's Mobile Cafe&quot;, which is often parked at the
point where the PW crosses the A635, and we hoped that that was
the white spot. We walked and watched, and it did indeed become a
van on a road. But before we got there, we were surprised by
several places where suddenly, unseen from above, the path
dropped down to cross a stream.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">After our snack at Snoopy's
(mugs of tea and butties (sandwiches), which we ate sitting on a
rock in the rain), we walked for a mile or so beside the
Wessenden reservoirs. We forded a stream at a waterfall and weir
and then climbed up out of the valley. By then the cloud had come
down again, and we couldn't see the various other reservoirs that
we knew we were passing. By the time we arrived at the A62, a
busy road with fast cars, it was dangerous even crossing the
road. We were going to stay at Globe Farm, half a mile down the
road. We tried walking beside the road, but cars couldn't see us,
and we couldn't see them until they were a few yards from us. It
was eerie and unsafe, so we turned back. We crossed the road and
found a back route. Moments before we arrived at Globe Farm, the
cloud lifted, and it was suddenly a beautiful bright late
afternoon with clear blue sky. Amazing transformation! After
showers and a rest, we had no problems walking beside the road to
a pub a mile away for our dinner.</font></p>
