        centuries-old methods, and environmentalists are
        interested in her meadows and pastures. They're full of
        wildflowers and herbs, because no fertilisers have ever

Middleton-in-Teesdale, we had the pleasant walk beside the Tees
that many people cite as the prettiest part of the Pennine Way.
As had been suggested, we scheduled a whole day for the eight
miles, in order to be able to walk slowly and savor it. There
were bluebells and other wildflowers by the path, and pretty
river scenes. Wynch Bridge, built by miners in 1704, was
supposedly the first suspension bridge in England.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">We passed the well-known
waterfalls, Low Force and High Force, and stopped to chat with a
sculptor, Keith Alexander, at work on a stone sheep. His sheep
will greet many walkers, since this area is a popular beauty spot.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The home where
we spent the night is whitewashed, as is typical of houses in
Teesdale. A large part of Teesdale is owned by Lord Barnard. The
story has several variations, but the gist of it is that several
centuries ago one of his forebears, a Duke of Cleveland, became
lost in a storm while hunting on his estate. He decreed that all
tenanted farmsteads on his estate be painted white in order to
show up clearly. And so they still are. Our host said that every
two years he's given the whitewash, and he has to put it on, as
part of his lease agreement with Lord Barnard. (I don't have a
picture, since it was raining when we arrived, and still raining
when we left.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The day from
Langdon Beck to Dufton was hard, because of the tremendous amount
of rain during the past week. We were soon back beside the Tees,
and the path was frequently actually covered by the river. There
were many awkward boulders to clamber over, before we turned a
corner and came face to face with Cauldron Snout. This is an
explosive 220 foot cascade of torrential water. One book says
&quot;the trail scrambles up rocky ledges beside the thrashing
torrent&quot;; another says &quot;A little modest scrambling is
needed to reach the top of the Cauldron Snout rocks, across which
great care is needed.&quot; Easy to say, but difficult to do,
when water is pouring over all the boulders. Fortunately, the
hand holds were all solid, so it didn't feel as dangerous as it
had looked.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">But then the
difficulties changed form. The rain was pouring down, and the
dozens of little fords of tributaries became deep stream
crossings. We spent considerable time walking up beside each of
the streams, trying to find rocks to cross on, or a narrower
channel that we could step over. This usually worked, but as the
day wore on and the streams got deeper, we ended up wading
through them. The river to our left was Maize Beck. Other walkers
at our B&amp;B that evening commented on what had shocked us, too,
that something with such a benign sounding name could be such a
major river. Apparently it's usually rocky and shallow, and the
Pennine Way crosses it on stepping stones. But when &quot;the
beck is running high&quot; (as our book says, and it certainly
was!) there's an alternative route, continuing along the the
north bank for another mile to a footbridge. We were happy when
we found the bridge, and even happier when our compass got us to
the major sight of the day, High Cup Nick. </font></p>

        the spectacular hollow of High Cup Nick.&quot; The
        Pennine Way arrives at the head of the valley, with views
        all the way to the Lake District mountains. This picture
        was taken after it had finally stopped raining, looking
        back toward the head of the valley, hidden on the left. </font><p><font

        up in front of the fire while talking with fellow walkers
        over tea and cookies. Then at dinner, at the Stag Inn, we
        were happy to find a couple, Judy and Rob, whom we had
        seen during the first week but not for the past five days.
        We checked our plans, and found that we'd be staying in
        the same towns or villages from then on to the end.</font></td>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The next day's
walk included the highest point on the Pennine Way, the top of
Cross Fell. But before that came Great Dun Fell, with its radar
station on top. Its &quot;golf ball&quot; complex is conspicuous
for miles, if it's not in a cloud. We saw it early in the day,
but before we got there the mist had enveloped it. We passed the
head of Dunfell Hush, a deep gash. Hushes are caused by washing
away the ground to expose the bedrock for mining. We had to use
the compass to find our way off Great Dun Fell, never having seen
the enormous &quot;golf ball&quot; while we were there. Then,
after we descended, climbed Little Dun Fell, descended, and
climbed Cross Fell, the cloud suddenly lifted! We could see back
to the radar dome on Great Dun Fell, and in fact see views in all
directions.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">On top of Cross Fell we met
a fellow doing a day walk. He had been here before, and we
followed him as he took a shortcut down to Greg's Hut, which was
in sight. It wasn't a good idea; there was a good reason why the
book suggested a longer, more circuitous route. We got into very
marshy ground, and at one point I suddenly sank in above my knees.
A few quick floundering steps and I was out, but it did startle
me!</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Greg's Hut is an old mine
building that has been rebuilt in memory of a walker, John
Gregory, for people to use as shelter from the fierce weather on
Cross Fell. We stopped in and enjoyed the relief from the wind
while we ate lunch.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The walk down
to Garrigill is six long miles of rocky track, probably another
corpse road, but certainly used by 18th and 19th century lead
miners. The area has been mined for lead since Roman times. Now
there are a few ruins of buildings, as well as spoil heaps, air
shafts and levels (access openings). Another relic is the
brightly colored little fragments of fluorspar, a by-product of
lead mining, sparkling blue along the path.</font></p>

        Steve and Martin, a father and son whom we had seen a few
        times, came in for drinks and to say &quot;good-bye&quot;,
        as they were planning on longer days from there on. We
        left our boots in front of the fireplace to dry, as we
        usually did. The next morning Thann found a shoelace
        almost burned through, apparently from an ember. Richard,
        the owner, was a little suspicious of the townspeople who
        had been at the bar, wondering whether they had been

town. For many days the weather forecasters had given their dire
predictions (&quot;flash floods&quot;, &quot;travel advisories
for motorists&quot;, &quot;gale force winds&quot;), but they had
always ended by promising a beautiful day on Friday. This was the
promised Friday, and they were right. In fact, according to our
guidebook, we were phenomenally lucky to have good weather there:
&quot;On a bright sunny day Alston has the air of a hilltop
village in Andalusia... Even on the other 364 days, of icy winds
or misty drizzle...&quot; The Market Square is in the center of
the old town; the Turks Head Inn is where we ate dinner.</font></p>
