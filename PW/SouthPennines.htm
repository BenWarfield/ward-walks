<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The third day was
interesting, as well as easy walking. We retraced our steps on
the back route behind Globe Farm, and rejoined the PW on pleasant
paths leading to Millstone Edge with its gritstone outcrops.
After a few miles we were at the footbridge across the M62.</font></p>

        miles of walking beside reservoirs and waterways, we saw
        Stoodley Pike appearing in the distance. This is a PW
        landmark, because it is visible for several days of the
        Way. When it first comes into view it's almost three
        miles away, but because of its height (120 feet), it
        looks deceptively close.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">After Stoodley Pike, we
dropped down through farms and then a pleasant woods to the
Calder Valley. We crossed the canal, river, and road, and started
the steep ascent out of the valley. We were near Hebden Bridge,
and Wainwright wrote of the paths in this area &quot;examples are
met of a type of footpath not found elsewhere on the Pennine Way.
Obviously they date back to the time of the construction of the
carraige roads, when there was as much concern for foot-travelers
as those with conveyances, and they were made with care in the
form of narrow paved ways between enclosing stone walls.&quot; A
good length of the route up from the valley is on these paths,
and we found them beautiful.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">It seemed as
if everyone we talked with later had stayed at Badgerfields Farm,
our very enjoyable B&amp;B north of Hebden Bridge. When we left
the farm the next morning we were again on walled paths, though
these were not as well maintained. The two photos below are from
the same place. On the left we are looking back up toward the
derelict barn on Badgerfields Farm. The photo on the right looks
ahead to the drop down to Colden Water.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Up from the Colden valley
we came to a lane where there was a hand-written sign with an
arrow pointing the way to a farm shop with food and supplies. We
had read about this shop, known as &quot;Aladdin's Cave&quot;, so
walked down the road to it. (This was the sort of very narrow,
stone-walled lane where you flatten yourself against the wall
when a car passes.) We loved Aladdin's Cave! It's a small, low
room in a farm, crammed full with canned and boxed food, a
refrigerator with cheeses, and all the small useful items that
one might need. We bought rolls and cheese for several days, and
other odds and ends, and were outside putting our packs back on
when a car drove up. A woman got out with a tray of freshly baked
pastries, so back into the shop we went, following her! </font></p>

ate our delicious pastries, and then crossed a part of
Heptonstall moor. </font></p>

above Graining Water, then by more reservoirs, and then up onto
the moors near Haworth. The wall stile onto the moor was higher
than most. And the sheep at Top Withins were more aggressive
scavengers than most. Perhaps it's because there are so many
tourists there, since it is (possibly) the ruins of the house
that Emily Bronte had in mind when she wrote about the Earnshaw
house, Wuthering Heights.</font></p>

was beautifully sunny. On the other side of Ponden Reservoir, we
climbed through pasturelands. The landmarks mentioned in the book
were old gateposts and a ruined barn; here we found both together:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Not much later
we came to Ickornshaw Moor. This was another of the sections that
used to be a nightmare but is now flagged over the worst parts.
We were soon across it, and climbing the stile off the moor and
into farmland.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">This was the
last of the moors and peat groughs for many days. We were now in
a pastoral landscape, with farms, fields, and pastures, as well
as frequent little villages. For a short time we were on a
towpath beside the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. We enjoyed seeing
the double-arched bridge near East Marton. Apparently the old
road dipped down to the bridge. When they wanted a faster road
without a big dip, they just built the new bridge on top the old
one, with another arch. </font></p>
