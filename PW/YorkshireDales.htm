Yorkshire Dales ---- Gargrave to Bowes ---- 62 miles ---- 5 days</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The walk the
next morning from Gargrave to Malham was beside the River Aire.
At one exciting moment, on a hilltop, we could see ahead of us
both Malham Cove (far left) and Gordale Scar (far right).
Limestone country had arrived!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><img

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Our plan was
to spend a restful afternoon in the Malham area. We first went to
our guest house, and were delighted by the approach to it, by a
stone footbridge over the Aire. Our room, too, was pleasing, with
a big carved wood bed and bow windows over the river.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">We first walked to Janet's
Foss. This is a pretty waterfall, but we were even more pleased
by the setting, a wooded dell by a stream, with the ground
covered by wild garlic.</font></p>

        indeed impressive. The tall (300 foot) limestone cliffs
        are imposing, and the sight is stunning as one rounds a
        bend and approaches the boulders and cascading waterfalls.
        There's a route up beside the waterfall, and we had hoped
        to do it, but the rainfall of the past few days made it
        too dangerous for our liking.</font></td>

    </tr>

</center></div>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The next day
started out toward Malham Cove. This, too, is impressive. It's
600 feet in span and 300 feet high. At one time a river flowed
from Malham Tarn (above the cove, several miles north) over the
edge of the cove, but now the water disappears underground,
emerging several miles away. The stream in the photo is one which
disappeared from yet another place, to reappear at the base of
the cove. They've found this out by placing dyes in the water.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><img
src="MalhamCove.jpg" width="480" height="300"></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The path goes up rock steps
at the left side of the Cove (this is a popular area), near the
limestone &quot;pavement&quot; on top of the Cove. This is an
amazing, ankle-twisting surface. It was wet (it had been
drizzling), so doubly difficult to walk on. We didn't venture
near the drop-off edge.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">We next turned north up the
&quot;dry valley&quot;. The water from Malham Tarn, higher up and
further north, ought to flow through this valley and over Malham
Cove, but instead it percolates down through the limestone close
to the tarn. At the north end of the valley, we went steeply up.
This photo looks back south down the dry valley:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><img
src="WatlowesDryValley.jpg" width="400" height="216"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">We stopped for
ice cream at a van near Malham Tarn. We were encouraged by the
cheerful woman there, who said &quot;Rain before 7, dry before 11&quot;.
It had certainly rained before 7. It wasn't yet 11, so we hoped
her &quot;old saying&quot; was right. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">A couple of
miles later, after going around Malham Tarn, we reached Fountains
Fell, the next objective. It's several miles of steady but not
steep climbing. We passed signs saying &quot;There are a number
of open mines shafts in this area. Please keep to the footpath.&quot;
We weren't tempted to stray, one reason being that the cloud had
come down on us - or we had come up to it - and visibility was
low. But when we got to the wall at the top, the cloud had lifted
enough for us to get an outstanding, exciting view of Penyghent. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><img
src="PenyghentFromFountains.jpg" width="472" height="300"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">We ate lunch
while looking at Penyghent, after starting down. (The &quot;dry
by 11&quot; part of the old saying didn't hold true today.) We
had this view to inspire us as we walked the mile of rocky
descent from Fountains Fell and the mile along a small road. </font></p>

</center></div>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Finally we
started to climb. There are the distinct layers of rock, making
the distinctive shelves of Penyghent. The bottom layer is
limestone and the top millstone grit. There's a straightforward,
though steep, path to the top. Almost to the top, that is -- for
the last short bit we had to resort to scrambling with hand-holds.
Or did we lose the path?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><img
src="PenyghentSteps.jpg" width="300" height="397"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The four mile
descent was very enjoyable, as the sun came out. The whole area
is filled with sink holes and caverns and potholes, where the
limestone has collapsed. Water flows into the potholes and
disappears. We passed near Hunt Pot, and went to see it.
Wainwright describes it as &quot;an evil slit&quot;, and indeed
it is. It's 15 feet long, six feet wide, and 200 feet deep. We
kept a healthy distance from the edge...</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><img
src="HuntPot.jpg" width="474" height="300"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The final
couple of miles into Horton-in-Ribblesdale are along a walled
lane. It delighted us, and we were very happy.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><img
src="DroveRoadToHorton.jpg" width="557" height="339"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">As we walked,
the sky became a cloudless blue and views were stunning.
Penyghent was now to our left across the pastures. It was all
totally beautiful.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="PenyghentFromRdToHorton.jpg"
width="557" height="369"></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The view out of our bedroom
window at the Golden Lion in Horton-in-Ribblesdale was of
Penyghent, beyond the church, so we continued our enjoyment of
the scene.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><img
src="PenyghentWithHortonChurch.jpg" width="459" height="339"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The next day
was back to the usual light rain, as we walked up another walled
lane, an old packhorse route. We stopped to chat with a fellow
who was repairing a drystone wall. He usually works with a
partner, but the other fellow didn't want to work in this foul
weather. They do about 10 yards a day. He estimated this
collapsed section as seven yards, and hoped to get it done by
himself.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="DryStoneWaller.jpg" width="594"
height="347"></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">As the rain
came down, it became wetter underfoot. On the rocky lane, it was
just wet puddles and not a problem. But on the next section, on
mud, it was difficult. I slipped and sat down ungracefully and
slid down a hill. I took a picture while standing on a stile,
looking down at the mud at the bottom, and then another picture
of the muddy terrain that we were having to deal with.</font></p>

</center></div>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">But there were plenty of
enjoyable sights, balancing out the problems under foot. There
were more potholes with amazing rivers swallowed up, rushing
underground. There was Ling Gill, a deep ravine, with an old
packhorse bridge at the top end of it.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><img
src="LingGillBridge.jpg" width="499" height="290"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">There was the
view of majestic Ribblehead Viaduct in the distance.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><img
src="RibbleheadViaduct.jpg" width="291" height="425"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">But then the
rain came in earnest, as well as the wind. We walked for several
miles along Cam High Road, a Roman road, named in the packhorse
days, straight as a Roman road is expected to be. By the time we
turned north along the side of Dodd Fell, the wind was fierce. We
finally dropped down to Hawes, and the White Hart Inn.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">It was raining
again the following day. I took some photos of the flagstones on
the path up Great Shunner Fell, to give an idea of what the path
would have been like if they hadn't been there. Piles of stones
like those in the last photo are a common sight, as many more
sections will eventually be flagged.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">At the top of
Great Shunner Fell is a typical plus-sign-shaped stone wind-break.
We walked around it and found the section with the best wind
protection, and enjoyed our lunch. These structures are quite
effective. When I stepped out of our corner to take the picture,
I was amazed at how strong the wind still was. We had been snugly
comfortable in our little corner!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The path down
from Great Shunner Fell is another &quot;corpse road.&quot; These
were used in past centuries to carry the dead to the nearest
church, which was often many miles away. The path, eventually a
walled lane, led to Thwaite. We had wonderful views of the valley
of Thwaite Beck, which leads to Swaledale. </font></p>

good while watching a sheep farmer with his crook, and his dogs,
checking on his sheep. Later he passed us in his tractor, with
dogs behind in a cage, going very slowly down the lane.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">At about this point, I
looked at my watch, and saw that we'd better hurry. We were to
spend the night at Doreen Whitehead's, in Keld, which was still
several miles away, over Kisdon Hill. We had stayed with her when
we did the Coast to Coast Walk, and the thought of her buttery
scones and tea, which we might miss, had us charging up the hill.
We still had time, though, to enjoy the wonderful views from
Kisdon Hill.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="SwaledaleFromKisdon.jpg" width="426"
height="276"></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">We had an hour
the next morning before the rain started again. This view back to
Keld includes the Whiteheads' house, Butt House, at left center,
with the village itself at the right.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><img
src="KeldButtHouse.jpg" width="423" height="260"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">For a while we
were on a farm road, and the scenes were pleasant.</font></p>

</center></div>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Then the rain
came again, and it became once again marshy walking. We were
drenched and soggy by the time we reached Tan Hill Inn. We could
see well-dressed people when we looked in the window, so we didn't
go in for a pint. We've heard since that we could and should have,
in spite of our looks.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Immediately
after Tan Hill, the Pennine Way leaves Yorkshire and enters
County Durham. We took the &quot;Bowes Loop&quot;, which adds a
few miles, but makes accommodations easier to arrange. As we
walked to Bowes, the sun came out and the walking was easy,
through farmland. Our stay at the Ancient Unicorn Inn was most
enjoyable, including a drive into Barnard Castle the following
morning for a quick tour.</font></p>
