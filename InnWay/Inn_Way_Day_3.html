We left Askrigg on a small road, climbing steadily for 
several miles up to Askrigg Common.&nbsp; Stopping and looking back, we had 
views to the flat top of Attleborough.<br />

<br />
<br />
We crossed open moorland 
		for a few miles before beginning to see down into Swaledale.&nbsp; Oxnop 
		Gill was on our left as we began dropping down.&nbsp; <br />
<br />

<br />
Some of the farms were in 
		the long-house style, a type introduced by the Vikings, in which the 
		house and barn were at the two ends of the same building.<br />
<br />

On down through the fields we went. <br />

<br />
<br />
As we neared the river, 
		we came to large areas of wild garlic.&nbsp; I love it!<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_4579.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
<br />
Soon we arrived at the 
		River Swale, at Ivelet Bridge.&nbsp; This is a packhorse bridge, built 
		in the 16th century.&nbsp; <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
This bridge was on a 
		"Corpse Way".&nbsp; The dead had to be carried to the church in Grinton, and 
		this bridge was on the route.&nbsp; At one end of the bridge is a 
		coffin stone, where the wicker basket carrying the corpse could be 
		rested. <br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="480" src="wIMG_9957.jpg" width="360" /><br />
<br />
<br />
We walked through fields 
		above the river.&nbsp; The Swale is usually fast-flowing, but now it 
		seemed dry and sluggish.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
The King's Head in Gunnerside provided our lunch 
		break, and we joined others at picnic tables in front.&nbsp; Some of 
		them were walking the Coast-to-Coast.&nbsp; Both the Coast-to-Coast and 
		our Inn Way were aiming for the night at Reeth, but the two routes are 
		different.<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="525" src="wIMG_4609.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
<br />
		Leaving Gunnerside we crossed back over the Swale.&nbsp; There were 
		outstanding views over the fields and field barns, back toward the 
		village.<br />
