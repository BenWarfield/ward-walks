Leaving Buckden, while climbing steeply up the side of Buckden Pike, we had beautiful views up Wharfedale toward Hubberholme.

<br />
		The route leveled off, and we had pleasant grassy walking.&nbsp; Later 
		we turned up a track toward Stake Moss.&nbsp; This track follows the 
		route of a Roman road, up and across the moor. It was four miles or so 
		of wild moorland, totally desolate except for sheep.<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="456" src="wIMG_4487.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
		We were on the track for several miles.<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_4493.jpg" width="720" /><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
And then we 
		turned off across the uplands.<br />
		<br />
		What glorious panoramas!<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="583" src="wIMG_4504.jpg" width="900" /><br />
<br />
<br />

There were 
		many ladder stiles,<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="405" src="wIMG_4505.jpg" width="540" /><br />
<br />as well as stone step stiles.<br />

<br /><img alt="" height="405" src="wIMG_4511.jpg" width="540" /><br />
<br />
	After several enjoyable miles we dropped down 
		into the hamlet of Stalling Busk, in Raydale.<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="482" src="wIMG_4523.jpg" width="900" /><br />
<br />
		Soon after we left Stalling Busk, we saw Semerwater.&nbsp; 
		This is a small lake, the result of the retreating glacier in 
		Wensleydale.&nbsp; The moraine left by the glacier blocked the water, 
		forming the lake.<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_4524.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
On down through the buttercups<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_9631.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
and past the ruins of a church.<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="449" src="wIMG_9638.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
We followed the path around the side of Semerwater.&nbsp; Here at the far end there was a 
		pleasingly bucolic scene with 
		geese and cows.<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_4532.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
The route then followed beside the River Bain to Bainbridge.&nbsp; Two miles 
long, this is the shortest river in Britain.&nbsp; It slices through the moraine 
left by the glacier.<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="476" src="wIMG_9685.jpg" width="717" /><br />
<br />
Soon we were heading down to the town of 
		Bainbridge.<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="408" src="wIMG_4537.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
We stopped for a pint at the Rose and Crown 
		(dated 1445, dirty boots welcome) before setting off on the last few 
		miles to Askrigg.<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_4542.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
Askrigg was only a few miles away, but the 
		suggested route was a longer, circuitous one.&nbsp; We passed by Nappa 
		Hall, a fortified manor house built in the mid 1400s.<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="525" src="wIMG_4548.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
Then after going down a steep bank and 
		crossing a river,<br />
<br />
		<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_9788.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
we crossed several more amazing fields of 
		buttercups, before finally arriving at Askrigg for the night.<br />
<br />
