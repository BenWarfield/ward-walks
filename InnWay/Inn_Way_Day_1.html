The Inn Way passes 26 pubs, and almost all of 
them had a sign in front proclaiming themselves to be one of the 26.&nbsp; 
There were three in Grassington, to start us on our way.<br />

On leaving Grassington we were immediately in typically 
outstanding Dales scenery.<br />

There were limestone pavements 
as we neared Grass Wood.<br />

<br />
For a long time we could see 
Kilnsey Crag in the distance.&nbsp; As we dropped down into Conistone, the rock 
face was clearly 
in view.<br />

<br />
Coming closer to Kilnsey Crag we could see 
		the climbers on it.&nbsp; Small wonder they were there -- this was a pleasant sunny Sunday 
afternoon.<br />

The walking continued to be superb.&nbsp; 
		During the afternoon we could see on our right Birks Fell, which we 
		would be crossing at the end of the day.<br />

When we finally started dropping down we could see the village of 
Buckden far below.<br />
<br />

<br />
Half an hour later, and Buckden looks nearer:<br />

We happily found our pretty B&amp;B, West 
		Winds.<br />
