There was a very low cloud covering the hilltops when we 
left Reeth.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="476" src="wIMG_0189.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
<br />
We crossed back over the Swale and were soon in Grinton, 
where we stopped in to visit the church.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="436" src="wIMG_4640.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
After Grinton, our route led upward, and we entered the cloud.&nbsp; At first 
there was no discernable path.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="529" src="wIMG_4650.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
<br />
When the cloud started to lift we began seeing shafts 
and spoil heaps from disused lead mines.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="439" src="wIMG_0286.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
<br />
At one point we saw a post some way off.&nbsp; We 
couldn't agree as to whether it was a tall post in the far distance or a short 
post not far away.&nbsp; Andy was sure of the latter, and to our dismay he said 
he would go to it and show us.&nbsp; By darn, he got there very quickly and put 
his hand on it to demonstrate.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="412" src="wIMG_4653.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
<br />
We crossed the top of Grinton Moor, and on the other 
side we were in a grouse hunting area, on a good gravel track for the hunters' 
vehicles.&nbsp; We passed some very substantial grouse butts.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="506" src="wIMG_4655.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />

<br />
At the 
bottom of the hill we were in Apedale, a desolate valley.&nbsp; Through the mist 
we saw a building, which the map identified as "Dent Houses".<br />
<br />

<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_0293.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
<br />
When we reached the bottom, we were surprised to see a 
mylar balloon bouncing over the grass.&nbsp; It floated down into the stream 
bed, but Andy rescued it.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="465" src="wIMG_4659.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
<br />
We solved the problem of what to do with it by tying 
it to a gatepost.
The two houses you see are "Dent Houses", which are shooters' huts.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="372" src="wIMG_4664.jpg" width="810" /><br />
<br />
<br />
We accepted the invitation of "The Estate",<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="414" src="wIMG_0306.jpg" width="576" /><br />
<br />
<br />
and found the room tidy, as it was supposed to be.&nbsp; 
We signed the guest book, and ensured that the door was firmly closed when we 
left, as we had been enjoined to do.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_0307.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
Onward, up and over the next hill, and Bolton Castle came into sight.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="524" src="wIMG_4672.jpg" width="810" /><br />
<br />
<br />
It looks like all ruins from this side, but there were in fact lots of intact 
rooms, one of which was a tea room where we were served a much-appreciated 
lunch.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="469" src="wIMG_0331.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
<br />
After lunch we were just in time for a birds of prey display in the castle 
garden.&nbsp; The bird being exhibited was actually a buzzard.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_0357.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
We spent a good while in the castle.&nbsp; Rooms ran the gamut, from ordinary, 
like this:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_0404.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
to this,&nbsp; Mary Queen of Scots's bedroom.&nbsp; She was held in custody here 
early in her imprisonment years.&nbsp; She had a large suite of rooms, and was 
allowed 51 attendants!<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="444" src="wIMG_4695.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
<br />
The views from the top of the tower were magnificent in every direction.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_0423.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
After several enjoyable hours, we left the castle, crossing fields and looking 
back.&nbsp; The castle was in sight for a long time.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="509" src="wIMG_4704.jpg" width="810" /><br />
<br />
<br />
We were now back in Wensleydale.&nbsp; One curiosity about Wensleydale is that it's 
one of the few Yorkshire dales not named after its river.&nbsp; 
Wensleydale's river is the Ure, which we crossed just below one of the sections 
of Aysgarth Falls.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="449" src="wIMG_4707.jpg" width="810" /><br />
<br />
<br />
A mile or so after Aysgarth Falls, we began walking beside Bishopdale Beck, a 
tributary of the Ure.&nbsp; Bishopdale is seven miles long, but before then we 
came to our pretty village for the night, West Burton.

We spent the night at the Fox and Hounds.<br />
