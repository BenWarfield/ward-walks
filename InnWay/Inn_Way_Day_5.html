Soon after leaving West Burton the next morning we were on a minor road with beautiful 
views of the Valley of Walden.&nbsp; The idyllic scene hasn't 
changed for centuries, with its scattered field barns.<br /><br />

<br />
<br />
After turning left up a farm track, we encountered a situation which was new to 
us.&nbsp; There was a calf outside the field that he probably should have been 
in.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="433" src="wIMG_4732.jpg" width="720" /><br />
<br />
We walked on up the track, and the calf walked with us, noisily telling us that 
he wanted to go back in with his friends and playmates.&nbsp; Not too much 
farther along we came to a gate.&nbsp; We managed to untie the rope that 
fastened it and let the calf back in.&nbsp; We hope that was the right thing to 
do!<br />
<br />

<br />
The sketch map in our book marked an "old railway carriage", so we weren't 
surprised to see it.&nbsp; But that didn't diminish our curiosity as to how it 
got there, or why.<br />

<br />
After we climbed a bit more, we were once again crossing moorland.&nbsp; There 
was often lots of cotton-grass.<br />
<img alt="" height="444" src="wIMG_4746.jpg" width="900" />

<br />
<br />
Sometimes we were in boggy areas, with their usual reedy grass. <br />
<br />

<br />
We were happy to arrive at the Thwaite Arms at lunchtime.&nbsp; This is in the 
tiny, remote village of Horsehouse.&nbsp; As the name suggests, the village and 
pub were an overnight stop on a packhorse and stagecoach route in past 
centuries.<br />
<br />

The present landlady is a good gardener and has made a pleasant beer garden out 
back.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" height="675" src="wIMG_0735.jpg" width="900" /><br />
<br />
In the afternoon we traversed Coverdale. There were first fields (here shared 
with Highland cattle)<br />
<img alt="" height="496" src="wIMG_4764.jpg" width="900" /><br />
<br />
and then a long hot uphill walk along a road.&nbsp; We were glad to get to 
Hunters Stone, which we knew was near the top.&nbsp; This is a guidestone, put 
there to help hunters, and monks from Coverham Abbey, find their way over the 
moor. <br />
<img alt="" height="418" src="wIMG_4777.jpg" width="630" /><br />
<br />
Soon after, we were back on pleasant paths across the moor, and then on a walled 
"green lane" which took us from the moor all the way down into Kettlewell.&nbsp; 
Green lanes are ancient unpaved public roads, many of which are now 
unfortunately popular with off-road recreational drivers.<br />

<br />
Finally, our home for the night in Kettlewell, the Blue Bell Inn.<br />
