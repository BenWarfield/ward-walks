		It was dreary but not raining when we 
started out of Kettlewell.<br />
		<br />
&nbsp;<img alt="" height="484" src="wIMG_0933.jpg" width="720" /><br />
		<br />
		Our route began with a climb, as usual.<br />
		<br />
		<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_0943.jpg" width="720" /><br />
		<br />
		There was a light rain as we crossed field after field, and wet stile 
		after wet stile.<br />
		<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_0956.jpg" width="720" /><br />
		<br />
		After a few miles we came to an area of disused mines, with old shafts 
		and spoil heaps.<br />
		<br />
		<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_0961.jpg" width="720" /><br />
		<br />
		Not much later we began descending on a "turf road", and we found 
		ourselves back in limestone country.<br />
		<br />
		<img alt="" height="483" src="wIMG_4798.jpg" width="900" /><br />
		<br />
		<img alt="" height="539" src="wIMG_4800.jpg" width="900" /><br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<img alt="" height="381" src="wIMG_4809.jpg" width="900" /><br />
		<br />
		Later we went through a former lead mining area, this one with 
		interesting information boards.&nbsp; We followed the numbered posters 
		until it started pouring rain.&nbsp; <br />
		<br />
		<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_1048.jpg" width="720" /><br />
		<br />
		<img alt="" height="295" src="wIMG_1048s.jpg" width="720" /><br />
		<br />
		Our route led us down a path to Hebden Beck.&nbsp; We had to cross the 
		beck several times on stones, and as we went downstream the river stones got 
		harder and harder to manage.&nbsp; The heavy rain was clearly raising 
		the water level fast.&nbsp; Half an hour later we were relieved to be in Hebden, 
		and we were looking forward to drying off a bit in the pub -- but to our dismay it 
		was closed for the afternoon.&nbsp; So we stopped in a bus shelter to 
		wipe our faces and shake off some water, like wet dogs.<br />
		<br />
		<img alt="" height="529" src="wIMG_1062.jpg" width="720" /><br />
		<br />
		Through Hebden then, and down to the suspension bridge that we remembered 
		fondly from the 
		Dales Way.<br />
		<img alt="" height="540" src="wIMG_1084.jpg" width="720" /><br />
		<br />
		Up the hill on the other side, looking back down to the suspension 
		bridge:<br />
		<img alt="" height="469" src="wIMG_1086.jpg" width="720" /><br />
		<br />
		Onward and upward, through another field.&nbsp; Maybe the cows were 
		wondering why we were out walking in the rain?<br />
		<img alt="" height="395" src="wIMG_1092.jpg" width="720" /><br />
		<br />
		Finally, up the familiar flagged path from Linton Falls<br />
		<img alt="" height="587" src="wIMG_1170.jpg" width="720" /><br />
		<br />
		and on into Grassington, to end a marvelous six days!<br />
		<img alt="" height="533" src="wIMG_4834.jpg" width="800" /><br />
		<br />
