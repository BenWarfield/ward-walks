        miles after leaving Kirk Yetholm, St.Cuthbert's Way
        accompanied the Pennine Way. These were the last few
        miles of the Pennine Way, and late afternoon would have
        seen tired bodies dragging themselves up the path. </font><p><font
        size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, the fingerpost
        also shows that we were on the E2, a 3030-mile route from
        Galway in Ireland to Nice in France. The part in Ireland
        hasn't been completed yet, so the walk now starts in
        Stranraer, where the ferry from Ireland arrives in
        Scotland. The E2 follows the Southern Upland Way eastward
        across Scotland, and in Melrose it picks up St.
        Cuthbert's Way. We had been on the E2 since Melrose, but
        I don't recall seeing any other markers for it.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The sky was
overcast, and when we heard a rumble we assumed it was thunder.
But it didn't sound quite right. Then after another rumble we
realized the sound came from the Otterburn military training base
in the south Cheviots. The rumbles continued for hours.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We knew that
we'd be turning left off the Pennine Way, and we spotted the
fingerpost ahead. You may just see it, with our fainter path
going to the left.</font></p>

        bottom corner of a plantation&quot;.
        (&quot;Plantation&quot; in Britain means an area with
        planted trees.) In the plantation, &quot;Where you are
        uncertain, look out for the tree trunks with their lower
        branches lopped off.&quot; We thought this an odd
        statement, until we entered the exceedingly dark woods.</font></td>
