<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We spent our
first night in Kelso. and the next morning we started out by
going to the abbey ruins. This was once a great abbey, with its
construction begun in 1128 and extending some 75 years. It was
damaged during the 1300s during wars with England, and was
repaired. But it was attacked again repeatedly by the English in
the 1540s. In 1545 the abbey was almost completely destroyed,
never to be restored.</font></p>

        crossing the Tweed over an interesting bridge. John
        Rennie, who designed it, later built Waterloo Bridge in
        London as a copy. When the Waterloo Bridge was
        demolished, the lamps were brought to the Kelso Bridge.</font><p><font

        one looks upstream to the place where the Teviot flows
        into the Tweed. This is called &quot;Junction Pool&quot;,
        and it's apparently a mecca for salmon fishermen. You can
        just see a boat. It's called a coble, and the coble
        boatmen hold the boat steady at the best places for the
        fisherman in the boat to catch a salmon. The mansion is
        Floors Castle, said to be the largest inhabited castle in
        Scotland. It's in fact not a fortified castle, but an
        18th century country home, the home of the Duke of
        Roxburghe.</font><p><img src="IMG_7678ss.jpg" width="700"

        founded most of the abbeys we visited. This castle
        changed ownership between the Scots and the English many
        times over the centuries. The castle was taken by the
        English during the Rough Wooing in the 1540s and then
        demolished as part of a peace treaty in 1551.</font></p>

on a lane with yet more colorful flowers. In addition to the
hawthorn, there was a mixture of gorse and Scotch broom, both
cheerfully bright yellow. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">But an hour later, after
we had climbed steadily up onto an open hilltop, storm clouds
began developing. In fact, we hastily put on our rain jackets
when hail started to pummel us. We had climbed about 1000 feet,
on Black Law. &quot;Law&quot; is a Scots word for hill.</font></p>

a small cafe and dried off while eating soup and sandwiches for
lunch. But by the time we left, the rain was pouring down. We put
on our full supply of rain gear and set off. It rained most of
the afternoon, as we walked along the pretty riverside path to
Hawick. Hence no more pictures for this second day!</font></p>
