Walk, May 2011</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">This walk was a
combination of two long-distance paths, mostly in the Scottish
Borders, but ending up in England. The first was the Borders
Abbeys Way and the second, St Cuthbert's Way. They meet in
Melrose. The Abbeys Way is a circuit, usually walked in five
segments. We started in Kelso and omitted the final segment
(Melrose to Kelso) in order to begin St Cuthbert's Way in
Melrose. The map below shows what we walked - the Borders Abbeys
Way in red and St. Cuthbert's in blue. The white dashed line is
the Scotland-England border.</font></p>

        Abbeys Way celebrates the four ancient abbeys, Kelso,
        Jedburgh, Melrose, and Dryburgh. These were all founded
        during the 12th century and destroyed during the
        &quot;Rough Wooing&quot;. The &quot;Rough Wooing&quot;
        refers to the period from 1543 to 1551, when Henry VIII
        was incensed by the refusal of the Scots to agree to a
        marriage between his son Edward and the infant Mary,
        Queen of Scots. But even during the centuries before
        that, the abbeys were all repeatedly attacked and burned,
        thanks to their location in the borderland between the
        frequently warring countries, England and Scotland.</font><p><font
        size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">St. Cuthbert's Way honors
        the seventh century Cuthbert. Early in his life he was
        prior at Melrose, and at the end of his life he was
        Bishop of Lindisfarne; hence the route leads from Melrose
        to Lindisfarne. Cuthbert was tremendously influential in
        the church and travelled widely. He was a conciliator
        during the Synod of Whitby, the conference that heard
        debates between the proponents of the Celtic Church and
        those of the Roman Church. Cuthbert's roots were in the
        Celtic Church, but when the Synod decided in favor of the
        Roman, Cuthbert adopted the Roman ways at Lindisfarne.
        His decision and pastoral teachings eased the transition
        for the whole Celtic Church.</font></p>
