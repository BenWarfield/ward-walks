<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The next day
started with several miles of uphill walking on an almost unused
road. No one likes road walking, but this was pleasant. There was
lots of yellow gorse to brighten the scene.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We finally
turned onto a farm road and were soon in a large field with
dozens and dozens of ewes with their lambs. We had a thoroughly
delightful half hour walking through the field.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">An hour later
we came to a golf course, which we walked through and beside for
many holes. For several holes we walked just behind a group of
cheerful young men, not wanting to get in the way of their shots.
At the end of the course, our route headed back uphill.</font></p>

        to pass an old stone dovecote, so we gathered that that's
        what this building was:</font></td>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We found a
Spar Market in Selkirk and bought lunch materials for the next
few days, as well as salads for dinner that evening. Our B&amp;B
was well out of town, and we figured we wouldn't want to walk
back to town after getting there. It was in fact an excellent,
elegant B&amp;B. Our hostess greeted us with the offer of a pot
of tea and shortbread cookies, which we happily accepted. She
chatted with us, and we admired the scene just beyond the French
doors in her sitting room - a hillside with a waterfall. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The next morning started
with a pretty walk through Selkirk Common. Soon thereafter we
began seeing horse riders. Then we realized that this was an
organized event, as the riders all had on similar vests.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="IMG_7916s.jpg" width="800"
height="504"></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We asked a rider and
learned that it was an endurance and navigational skills
competition. We had read about many riding events in the Selkirk
and Hawick area. There are the &quot;Common Ridings&quot;
annually, commemorating historical happenings in the Borders, but
we weren't there at the right time for those.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Around lunch-time we came
to Abbotsford, Sir Walter Scott's home. One approaches it down a
path from the hillside above. Scott spent many years having it
built, in this rather fanciful medieval style. We didn't actually
pay to see the house itself, but there was a little cafe, so we
enjoyed tea and sandwiches instead!</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">For a couple of days we
had been seeing the Eildon Hills in the distance. These are three
volcanic hills visible for many miles in all directions. They are
behind Melrose, where we were to spend the night, and during the
day they kept growing in height. There are two in most pictures;
the third peak is usually hidden.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="IMG_7923s.jpg" width="900" height="662"></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We were in Melrose early
enough to leave our packs at the B&amp;B before going to the
abbey. Melrose was founded by David I, in 1136, though its ruins
are all from a rebuilding after it was heavily damaged by the
English in the 14th century.</font></p>

- but obeyed the admonition not to go up the final set of steps.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We chose one of the
multitudinous pubs in town for dinner and celebrated having
finished the Borders Abbeys Way. Actually, we were omitting the
last leg of it, from Melrose to Kelso, where we had started. We
wanted to start the St. Cuthbert's Way, which begins in Melrose.
We went to bed, primed to start St. Cuthbert's Way by climbing
the Eildon Hills the next morning.</font></p>
