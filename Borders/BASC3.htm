<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The first day
of our St. Cuthbert's Way began with a climb up the Eildon Hills,
to the col, or gap, between two of them. As we climbed we
frequently stopped to look back at Melrose. Here's an early view
back, with the abbey still visible:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">An hour or so
later we had descended the other side of the Eildons, had stopped
for snacks in the village of Bowden, and were walking beside
Bowden Burn. Here, as was often the case, we were walking in a
thick growth of wild garlic. It's fortunate we all like garlic,
because the air is filled with its scent.</font></p>

        we were at the final one of our four great abbey ruins,
        Dryburgh Abbey. It too was established under the
        influence of David I, in the 12th century. We spent a
        long time wandering around, admiring the evocative old
        sandstone buildings.</font><p><img src="IMG_7997s.jpg"

found a well-placed picnic table for our lunch:</font></p>

src="IMG_8005s.jpg" width="1000" height="525"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">After
visiting the abbey we had a pleasant walk beside the River Tweed,
the path again thick with wild garlic.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We found our
B&amp;B, a mile on the far side of St. Boswell's, and relaxed for
a while before going back into town for dinner. We had very good
meals at the Buccleuch Arms Hotel (that's pronounced
&quot;buh-kloo&quot;), a friendly country inn.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The B&amp;B
was a rather grand house set in lovely grounds, and I
particularly liked the walled garden as we walked down her drive
the next morning. It reminded me of a childhood favorite book,
&quot;The Secret Garden&quot;. What was behind the wall?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="IMG_8037s.jpg" width="1000" height="577"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We stopped
(for a good while) at a good book shop in St. Boswell's - someone
at the B&amp;B in Melrose had told us about it. When we finally
left town, we almost immediately were up above the Tweed again,
again with the Eildon Hills in sight. We stood and talked for a
while with a man who was leaning on a fence, enjoying the view.
He said he loves it, and he stops there every day on his walk.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We had lots
of fun a little farther along, where there was a bank filled with
sand martin holes. The martins were zipping in and out in great
numbers and at great speeds. We kept trying to get a picture of
them - but with no luck. You'll have to take my word for it,
there really were dozens of them!</font></p>

        to pump water from a spring up to their house. The pump,
        in one of the two upper rooms, was worked by donkeys,
        going round and round. The spring is in the lower room.</font><p><font
