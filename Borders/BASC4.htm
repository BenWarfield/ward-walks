<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Since we had
made a detour off St Cuthbert's Way to spend the night (again) in
Jedburgh, we started the day with a couple of miles returning to
the route. First, as we left town, we retraced our steps along
the Jed Water, across from the cliff-face of Old Red Sandstone.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Further
along, we could look to our left, over the field of rape seed,
and still see the Eildon Hills as well as the Waterloo Monument.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="IMG_8120s.jpg" width="900"
height="539"></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We were glad
to walk again through a row of gorgeous horse chestnut trees.
When we had come through six days before, the wind had been
fierce, and we hadn't been surprised to find a freshly-fallen
tree limb across the path. All was calm this morning.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="IMG_8123s.jpg" width="900"
height="443"></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">We arrived
back at Dere Street, for the last bit of it that we would be
walking. Interesting to contemplate that St. Cuthbert, back in
the 7th century, would likely have walked along this very route.
But we soon turned off, for some flowery edge-of-woodland
walking. The forget-me-nots and the red campion are a great
combination.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Half an hour
later we came down through another woods to a footbridge crossing
Oxnam Water, with more Old Red Sandstone cliffs. Here we're
looking back down at it, pausing as we climbed up (and up and up)
a hill.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Several hours
later we were hungry, but it was hard finding a place to sit. The
woods were all wet, with no inviting surfaces. But out of the
woods, the wind had picked up and made stopping unappealing. This
wall beside a rape-seed field cut the wind,</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">and when we
crossed a stile at a wall corner, we found a lovely spot!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">After lunch,
over another hill, we had our first view of the Cheviots, the
mountain range that we would be skirting during the next day or
so.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Cessford
Castle (visible in the picture above as a small red rectangle)
was our next landmark. It looked interesting, as we approached
it:</font></p>

        stronghold of the Ker family, a family of Border Reivers
        in the Jedburgh area. But it turned out that one can't go
        into the building, as it's unsafe.</font><p><font

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The Ker
family was not a peace-loving bunch of people. Spelled sometimes
Ker, sometimes Kerr, the two branches of the family were in a
perpetual deadly feud. The Cessford branch fought for James VI,
while the other branch supported Mary, Queen of Scots.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">An hour later
we were in Morebattle, our stop for the night. The origins of the
name have nothing to do with war - it's from &quot;mere&quot;,
meaning lake, and &quot;botl&quot;, an Anglian word for hamlet.
What a pretty village! We stayed at the Templehall Inn, a
&quot;family run village inn, owned and run by a local
couple&quot;. The two rooms we stayed in were half the hotel
rooms - it wasn't enormous. We thoroughly enjoyed both the inn
and the village.</font></p>

village people were so cheerful and friendly!</font></p>

short day, and we were in Kirk Yetholm by early afternoon. Kirk
Yetholm is known as the ending point of the Pennine Way. We were
amused by the decoration in front of one of the village cottages
- boots, presumably of walkers who had completed the PW and
discarded their worn out footwear!</font></p>
