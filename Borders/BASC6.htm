        route. After maybe 15 minutes of floundering through
        heather, we surprised ourselves by finding it. No one
        knows for sure the reasons for these stone-age markings,

        spittle. We walked on, as calmly and steadily as we could
        manage. He finally stopped, but that was one of our more
        uncomfortable few minutes.</font><p align="center"><img

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The next
objective was St. Cuthbert's Cave. This was, it's said, the spot
where monks from Lindisfarne rested for the first night when they
were fleeing from the Vikings. They were carrying the coffin with
St. Cuthbert's remains. Unbelievably, they carried it from place
to place for seven years.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">After
climbing over the hill behind the cave, we had our exciting first
glimpse of the end of our walk - the island of Lindisfarne.
There's a castle on a little hill on the island, and that's
what's visible from far away. But you do have to look closely:</font></p>

        we had just a couple of miles to walk before reaching the
        causeway to Lindisfarne. One interesting event was the
        crossing of the East Coast Main Line. The trains pass at
        125 mph, and one is supposed to telephone a signalman to
        ask permission to cross. A couple coming toward us, after
        walking over the tracks, told us that they hadn't managed
        to make the phone on their side work.While we were
        talking, a train whizzed past, and the couple looked a
        little shaken. We did as we were instructed, lifting the
        receiver in a box and pushing a button. We were told that
        we could proceed, which we did.</font><p><font size="4"

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">There was
another World War II reminder that we encountered just before
reaching the North Sea. We were walking parallel to the edge of
the sea through giant concrete anti-tank blocks, part of the
coastal defence.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Lindisfarne
is an island part of each day, when the causeway is under water.
One has to check the tide tables and plan accordingly. We had
checked long before, and had in fact decided to stay in Fenwick
on that basis. One could walk on the side of the causeway. But
the other possibility, which we chose, was to walk across the
sands as St. Cuthbert would have done. It was 2 1/2 miles that
way, somewhat shorter than the causeway. It was exciting! There
was sometimes easy sand, sometimes shell-covered sand, sometimes
water-covered (a couple of inches) sand, and sometimes mud. There
was a squelchy weed-covered deep stream to cross. The wind was
blowing very hard, and it was cold, so our bare feet were quickly
numb. A storm blew in, and we were drenched in a matter of
seconds. But we were so glad that we had finished the walk that
way!</font></p>

fitting to end the story of our walk along St. Cuthbert's Way
with the statue of St. Cuthbert in the priory:</font></p>
