<p><font size="3" face="Century Gothic"><strong>Glyndwr's Way
starts in the town of Knighton, near the border of Wales with
England. We arrived about 4pm, having flown into Manchester
Airport that morning and taken several trains. Our plan was to
walk the 7 miles to the village of Llangunllo. Because of slow
and cancelled trains we were later than we had expected, so we
telephoned the B&amp;B to say we'd be there about 7:00. Jenny,
our hostess, offered to come pick us up, but we thanked her and
said we'd rather walk -- and set off. The official start is at
the clock tower. We had been here in 2000, because the Offa's
Dyke Path also goes through Knighton. We had used that phone box
for a bunch of calls then, as now!</strong></font></p>

tract, almost 5,000 acres, cared for by a wildlife trust. Soon
after we entered the area we came to &quot;Short Ditch&quot;, a
rampart of unknown origins. It may have been part of Edmund
Mortimer's defences again Glyndwr, or it may date back to the
time of Offa's Dyke, in the 8th century.</strong></font></p>

Fynydd in mid-afternoon, and stopped at the village shop (the
first shop we'd seen for three days). We didn't actually need
anything, but enjoyed looking around and chatting with the women
there. We bought ice cream, and sat at their picnic table to rest
and enjoy the ice cream. We stopped in at the nearby New Inn
(quite old, of course) to see whether we had to book for dinner.
(We didn't have to, but did, anyway.) We then walked the couple
of miles to our B&amp;B. Since it wasn't on Glyndwr's Way and the
directions given to us were sketchy, we weren't at all certain
which way to go. We walked along a little road in the general
direction, but it petered out. By good fortune, we came across an
old shepherd walking his dogs.</strong></font></p>

remembered that he said to turn right at the chapel, the other
remembered it as left. Fortunately we tried going right, and in
another half-mile we found the B&amp;B. We showered and rested
