Fynydd to Llanidloes</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Century Gothic"><strong>We didn't return to
Llanbadarn Fynydd the next morning, but followed a route
suggested by our B&amp;B hostess, cutting across the countryside
and through a few farms, till we joined up again with Glyndwr's
Way. At one of these farms we saw a (frightening) sign which we
saw many times later.&nbsp; It looks like a &#147;neighborhood
watch&#148; sign, but for sheep farms:</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Century Gothic"><strong>As we walked through
another farm, they were bringing in a bunch of sheep.&nbsp; We
chatted with the farmer, who was happy that at one o'clock the
ban on movement of sheep was to be lifted.&nbsp; The
foot-and-mouth cases a month or so before had brought on the
movement restrictions, keeping farmers from taking sheep to
market.&nbsp; He said they had picked out the fat sheep to
take.&nbsp; Sadly, for the farmer at least, just a few days later
a new case of foot-and-mouth was found, and the restrictions were
reinstated.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Century Gothic"><strong>Not much later we were
back on Glyndwr&#146;s Way, for a lovely stretch of
walking.&nbsp; We were on a ridge, with views in every direction,
springy turf underfoot, and gorse surrounding us.</strong></font></p>

turned off the ridge and descended.&nbsp; On the hilltop in front
of us, but not actually on our route, was another earthworks,
again all that remained of a 13th century castle.</strong></font></p>

implies, there was once an abbey here.&nbsp; It was founded in

Glyndwr, and finally from Henry VIII.&nbsp; Glyndwr thought that
the monks were English spies, and sacked the abbey in 1401.&nbsp;
Then in 1536, during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Abbeys, it
was demolished. Now there's very little left.</strong></font></p>
