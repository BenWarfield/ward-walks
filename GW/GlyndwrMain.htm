<p><font face="Century Gothic"><strong>Glyndwr's Way is a
(roughly) 135-mile route through mid-Wales. It's named for Owain
Glyndwr, who led the Welsh in a revolt against the English in the
15th century. For some of us, our first encounter with Glyndwr
was in Shakespeare's plays, where he was called Owen Glyndower.
He was born in this part of Wales, and many of his battles were
fought in the area. </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Century Gothic"><strong>The walk is in a very
sparsely populated part of the country -- beautiful, sometimes
gentle and sometimes wild, sometimes farmland and sometimes
upland moors -- with an interesting variety of landscape. It was
all hills -- not mountains, but rounded hills. Since Glyndwr's
Way is not a much walked route, the paths were usually grassy and
pleasant under foot. Often, in fact, there were no paths at all.
The B&amp;Bs and inns were all welcoming. It was a great walk!</strong></font></p>
