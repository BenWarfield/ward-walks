LLangadfan</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Century Gothic"><strong>After reluctantly
leaving Lloyd's Hotel, but before setting off from Llanidloes, we
bought lunch supplies and walked around the town. Llanidloes has
a 16th century market hall, an elegant structure. People seem to
like to sit and relax on its benches.</strong></font></p>

pleasant walking brought us to the Clywedog dam and
reservoir.&nbsp; Here's our first view of it:</strong></font></p>

century monastery!</strong></font></p>

to the path we had descended on.</strong></font></p>

again on a typically straight Roman road, with sheep standing
guard.</strong></font></p>

built in the 16th century, but it's fondly thought of as
such.&nbsp; The next morning was a Wednesday.&nbsp; Ever since
Edward I granted a charter to Machynlleth in 1291 to have a
market on Wednesday, they've had a weekly market.&nbsp; The stall
in this photo is in front of Glyndwr's Parliament Building.</strong></font></p>
