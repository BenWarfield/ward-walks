headland we could see the beach called Porth Neigwl, or Hell's
Mouth. The name in English reflects the large number of
shipwrecks here during the days of sailing ships. We knew that we
would have several miles of walking along this beach, and
wondered whether it was possible at high tide (which we figured
it was about to be). We peered at the beach, trying to see how
wide or narrow it was.</font></p>

boulder clay, and it's splitting off in great chunks. It was hard
even walking (skidding and sliding) down to the beach on the
slippery clay. But as it turned out, the walk along the beach was
superb! We enjoyed it thoroughly. The stones seemed especially
colorful to us. The clay cliffs beside us were tremendously
interesting, with their weird shapes.</font></p>

down to the beach through a development of modern villas and the
sand seemed plenty wide enough. We had a pleasant walk of almost
a mile before turning inland. The beach ended abruptly at a
steep-sided hill. We walked beside the hill until we found a
steep path going up it. At the top the path turned right and
contoured around the edge of the hill for over a mile. </font></p>

        were particularly holy people. The town, Llanbedrog, is
