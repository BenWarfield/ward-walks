<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">From Carrog Farm we
walked on quiet lanes to rejoin the Coastal Path. We saw on our
map that we would pass a megalithic standing stone. We did, and
we saw it in the field, but the path to it had been most
definitively blocked off - with the footpath sign knocked down,
even.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">A few miles later
we were once again walking through gorse on our way back down to
the coast. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="ReturnToCoast.jpg" width="720" height="533"></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">We reached it near
Porthor, or Whistling Sands. It's said that on the sand your feet
will make a squeaking sound, but we couldn't hear it. There was
another couple on the beach, an unusual sight for us on this
walk.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="WhistlingSands.jpg" width="504" height="378"></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Here's the view
back to the beach, after we climbed up the hill at the far end:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="WhistlingSands2.jpg" width="576" height="432"></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">The path after this
was very pleasant and easy under foot. When the hill Mynydd
Anelog came into view, however, I was apprehensive that we might
have to walk around the rather steep side above the water.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="Anelog1.jpg" width="504" height="231"></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">But when we sat for
a snack we were happy to see a path going up the hill that we
could get to easily. It's hard to spot in this photo, but it goes
up to the right of the wall that you can see. What you don't see
in this picture is that we first had to go down to the water
level!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="Anelog2.jpg" width="576" height="432"></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Several hours later
we were going down the other side of Mynydd Anelog. It had turned
into a stunningly beautiful afternoon. We were nearing the tip of
the peninsula, but we cut the corner a bit and didn't get to the
furthest point. The water in the photo below is on the south
coast.</font></p>

        it still was on wobbly legs.</font></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">The
views continued to be outstanding. We came to a farm lane, and
then found ourselves on our map. We turned westwards, toward the
tip of the peninsula.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="TowardTip.jpg" width="792" height="305"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Finally,
in the late afternoon, we saw the object of the pilgrims'
pilgrimages: Ynys Enlli, or Bardsey Island.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="Bardsey.jpg" width="656" height="492"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">An
hour later, after we had made the turn and started walking along
the south coast, we could see Aberdaron ahead of us. The path,
though still a path above the coast, seemed quite different from
the paths of the past few days.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">It was
after 6:00 and starting to get dark, but Aberdaron wasn't far
away, and the moon rising just above it was beautiful. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><img
src="AberdaronMoon.jpg" width="720" height="540"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">We
dropped down to the boulders that you can see at the back of the
closer beach in the photo above, and tried scrambling across
them. It turned out to be difficult, so we went up to the bank
behind.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="AberdaronBoulders.jpg" width="576"
height="432"></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Then
after we finally got to the end of the boulders, close to
Aberdaron, we came to a river that we couldn't cross. We had to
climb back up the hill and clamber over a gate to get to a road
down into town. We immediately found our Ship Hotel and went in.
There was a note to us saying that we were in Room 4, and that
Alun would be back soon - but he turned up right away. He's a
great fellow, and his cheerfulness provided a merry ending to yet
another excellent day!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">We
were excited the next morning when we looked out of our room
window to see Y Gegin Fawr (the Big Kitchen) right across the
street. This was a communal kitchen where pilgrims would have a
meal before embarking for the trip to Bardsey. It's now a café,
but it was still closed for the winter. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">We
spent the morning enjoying Aberdaron, an appealing village. In
the photo below you see the Ship Hotel on the left, the hotel
where we ate dinner just behind it, the friendly shop where we
bought postcards and books to the right of the pink house, and Y
Gegin Fawr on the right. The post office and Spar Market were to
my left. The only other important building is the church, which
is up the hill behind the Ship Hotel.</font></p>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">We spent a
        long time visiting the church, as we happened to go in
        while the vicar was there. We chatted for a good while.
        We had already read a lot about the church, St Hywyn's.
        Its original fifth century wooden building was replaced
        by a stone structure in 1137. Some parts of this 12th
        century building remain, including the west door and
        surrounding area. The church was extended in 1400.
        Inside, there are a couple of sixth century gravestones
        that were found nearby, with inscriptions. The one below
        says &quot;VIRACIUS PBR HIC IACIT&quot; (Viracius the
        priest lies here).</font></td>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">The
church is beside the sea and thus has had problems over the
centuries with its graveyard falling into the water. There's now
a sea-wall to protect it. As you can see, by the time we went
outside, a fog or sea-mist had rolled in.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">In the afternoon we
left Aberdaron for the short walk, just a few miles, to
Penarfynydd Farm where we were spending the night. The thick fog
stayed all day. We went through many fields and over many stiles.
I took a picture of one stile which was marvellously complicated,
and then of the view and choice on the other side of the stile:</font></p>

        color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">After a few more
        muddy fields we were at Penarfynydd Farm. Ursula Jones
        had telephoned us to say to say that they would be out,
        but that we should come in and make ourselves at home. We
        did, and she arrived not much later. She gave us tea and
        cakes, and we sat by the warm fire. Later she made us a
        good dinner, and we went to sleep to the sound of rain.</font></p>
