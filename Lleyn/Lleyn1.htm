<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">We soon saw the
church of Llanfaglan up in a field on our left. It's in an
evocatively isolated spot, set in a walled enclosure. It's cared
for now by a group called &quot;the Friends of Friendless
Churches.&quot;</font></p>

src="Llanfaglan1.jpg" width="800" height="346"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">We
looked around it for a good while. A nearby farmer had told us to
look for a pirate's grave. We searched, not finding it, but then
read later that the story about a pirate's grave is false. All
the same, we very much enjoyed the church and its setting.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">We then set off
inland, over stiles and through often muddy fields. After a
couple of miles, we came to Dinas Station on the Welsh Highland
Railway. This railway was closed in 1930 and is being rebuilt
now; it will run steam trains from Caernarfon to Porthmadog.</font></p>

Thann and his pack, so he would have to take it off.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Later yet we almost
accidentally found a cromlech, or megalithic burial chamber. We
had stopped to check the map, and just happened to look in the
field beside us. We saw what looked to be a cromlech, or dolmen,
and walked over to it. It was indeed a very proper and pleasing
cromlech -- and in fact we then saw that it was marked on our
map.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">A mile or so later
we came to our stopping place, and our weary feet were relieved
to stop walking, after this 16-mile first day. Fortunately, we
could eat dinner where we were staying, at the Bryn Eisteddfod.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">We were in Clynnog
Fawr, and the next morning we set off to visit its church, St
Beuno's. Saint Beuno founded a monastery here in the 7th century.
It was burned down by the Vikings in 978, rebuilt, and then
burned down again by the Normans. The churches here were a
gathering place for pilgrims on their way to Bardsey Island, or
Ynys Enlli, off the tip of the peninsula. It was said that three
pilgrimages to Bardsey were equivalent to one to Rome. The church
was unfortunately closed when we tried to visit it, but we saw
the early (possibly 10th century) sundial beside the church, and
enjoyed walking around. From the church we could see clearly our
first objective of the day, the hill called Bwlch Mawr.</font></p>

went back down almost to sea level, climbed up over the pass on
Yr Eifl, walked down the other side while looking longingly at
the valley of Nant Gwrtheyrn which we had hoped to visit, and
five hours later came to the church at Pistyll. Pistyll is
another church where pilgrims used to stay on their way to Ynys
Enlli. It still has a lepers' window, as well as a medieval herb
garden. But since the sun was setting and we had several miles to
go, we had to put this church, along with Nant Gwrtheyrn, on our
&quot;see on a later trip&quot; list. </font></p>

again with sore feet and aching muscles, we arrived in Morfa
Nevyn for the night. We were too tired even to walk to a pub for
dinner!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">The
next morning started with several very enjoyable hours on the
spit of land sticking out to the west of Morfa Nefyn. There's a
harbor at the end of a wide bay, the hamlet of Porthdinllaen on
the beach, and a long golf course up above. We started walking
beside the golf course, planning to drop down to the beach and
the hamlet.</font></p>

Ty Coch Pub, a well-known pub with a webcam which we had been
looking at while at home. (Ty means house; coch means red.)</font></p>
